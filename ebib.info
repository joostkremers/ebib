Ebib
****

Ebib is a program with which you can manage BibTeX database files
without having to edit the raw `.bib' files. It runs in GNU/Emacs,
version 21.1 or higher (lower versions are not supported).

It should be noted that Ebib is _not_ a minor or major mode for editing
BibTeX files. It is a program in itself, which just happens to make use
of Emacs as a working environment, in the same way that for example
Gnus is.

The advantage of having a BibTeX database manager inside Emacs is that
X is no longer required, as Emacs can run on the console, and also that
some integration with Emacs' TeX and LaTeX modes becomes possible. For
example, you can push a BibTeX key from Ebib to a LaTeX buffer, or,
vice versa, when you're in a LaTeX buffer, you can consult your BibTeX
database and insert a key from it into the document. Another advantage
of Ebib is that it is completely controlled by key commands: no
stressful mouse movements are required, as with most other (usually
X-based) BibTeX database managers.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Next: Starting Ebib,  Up: Installation

1.1 Manual installation
=======================

To install Ebib, so that it will be loaded automatically when Emacs is
started, simply copy the file `ebib.el' to somewhere in your load path
and add the following line to Emacs' init file `~/.emacs':
(autoload 'ebib "ebib" "Ebib, a BibTeX database manager." t)

On a default installation, the load path probably only contains system
directories. If you want to run `ebib.el' from somewhere else (e.g.,
directly from the source directory), you can add this directory to your
load path:
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/ebib"))

Note: if you do not know what your load path is set to, go to the
`*scratch*' buffer, type `load-path' on an empty line, put the cursor
right after it and type `C-j'. The value of `load-path' will then
appear in the buffer.

Alternatively, you can load Ebib directly by putting the following in
`.emacs':
(load "/path/to/ebib")

The difference between `load' and `autoload' is that the former loads
Ebib immediately and thus slows down Emacs' startup (a bit), while the
latter loads Ebib only when it is called (and thus slows down Ebib's
first time start up a bit).

It is recommended to byte-compile the source, Ebib runs quite a lot
faster when it is byte-compiled. You can do this either within Emacs
with `M-x byte-compile-file' (recommended on OS X), or from your shell
by going into the directory where you put `ebib.el' and typing:
emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ebib.el

This will create a file `ebib.elc', which Emacs will load instead of
`ebib.el'

1.2 Starting Ebib
=================

Once Ebib has been installed and is loaded, you can start it with `M-x
ebib'. This command is also used to return to Ebib when you have put
the program in the background. You can bind this command to a key
sequence by putting something like the following in Emacs' init file:
(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'ebib)

You can of course choose any key combination you like. (In Emacs, key
combinations of `C-c' `<letter>' are reserved for the user, so that no
package may set them.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Installing the info file,  Prev: Starting Ebib,  Up: Installation

1.3 Installing the info file
============================

The Ebib manual is available as an info file. If you want this to be
accessible from within Emacs, you need to put it in a directory where
Emacs can find it. One way to do this is to put `ebib.info' in one of
the standard info directories. Make sure to run `install-info ebib.info
dir', so that Emacs knows about the new info file.

Alternatively, you can leave `ebib.info' in Ebib's source directory and
add that dir to `Info-additional-directory-list'. It contains a
suitable `dir' file, so there's no need to run `install-info'.

2 Basic Usage
*************

A BibTeX database is somewhat of a free-form database. A BibTeX entry
consists of a set of field-value pairs. Furthermore, each entry is
known by a unique key. The way that Ebib navigates this database is by
having two windows, one that contains a list of all the entry keys in
the database, and one that contains the fields and values of the
currently highlighted entry.

When Ebib is started, the current windows in Emacs are hidden and the
Emacs frame is divided into two windows. The top one contains a buffer
that is called the _index buffer_, while the lower window contains the
_entry buffer_. When a database is loaded, the index buffer holds a
list of all the keys in the database. You can move through these keys
with the cursor keys. In the entry buffer, the fields of the currently
highlighted entry are shown, with their values.

In this chapter, all basic functions of Ebib are described, so that you
can get startet with it. At times, reference will be made to later
chapters, where more specific functions are described.

Ebib has a menu through which most functions can be accessed.
Especially some of the lesser used functions can only be accessed
through the menu (unless you assign key shortcuts to them, of course.)

2.1 Getting Started
===================

Ebib is started with the command `M-x ebib'. Entering this command
hides all the windows in the current Emacs frame and replaces them with
two windows: the top one contains the index buffer, the bottom one,
taking up the larger part of the screen, contains the entry buffer. The
index buffer is named `none', to indicate that no database has been
loaded. If you open a database, or start a new one, the index buffer
will carry its name.

You can quit Ebib by typing `q'. You will be asked for confirmation,
and you will receive a warning if you happen to have an unsaved
database. The command `z' can also be used to leave Ebib. However,
unlike `q', which completely quits Ebib, `z' only lowers it, so that it
remains active in the background. The `.bib' files that you have opened
remain loaded, and you can return to them by typing `M-x ebib' again.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Opening a bib File,  Next: Navigating a bib File,  Up: Getting Started

2.1.1 Opening a `.bib' File
---------------------------

Loading a `.bib' file into Ebib is done with the command `o'. Ebib
reads the file that you specify, and reports how many entries it found,
how many `@string' definitions it found, and whether a `@preamble' was
found. Note that when Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it only reads entry
types (e.g. `book, article, phdthesis' etc.) that it knows about.
Fields (e.g. `author, title, year' etc.) that Ebib does not know about,
are loaded (and saved) but not displayed, so they cannot be edited.
Therefore, you should make sure that all the entry types and fields
that your databases use are defined. A sensible set has been
predefined, so that anyone who's using standard BibTeX entry types
should have no problem loading an existing `.bib' file into Ebib. If,
however, you have custom entry types, or custom fields in your `.bib'
files, you should define them. This can be done by selecting "Options |
Modify Entry Types" from the Ebib menu. (See also the chapter on
customising Ebib, esp. Entry types (#entry-types).)

Every time Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it produces a few log messages.
These are written into a special buffer `*Ebib-log*'. If Ebib
encounters entry types in the `.bib' file that it doesn't know, it will
log a warning. If Ebib finds something that it believes to be
incorrect, an error will be logged. If any warnings or errors occur
while loading the `.bib' file, Ebib tells you so after loading the
file. To view the log file, press `l' in the index buffer.

Note that even if it detects warnings or errors, Ebib will try to
continue parsing the rest of the `.bib' file. That means that normally,
only the entry in which an error occurs is not read. Entries occurring
after the problematic one are read.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Navigating a bib File,  Next: Starting a New bib File,  Prev: Opening a bib File,  Up: Getting Started

2.1.2 Navigating a `.bib' File
------------------------------

Once you've opened a `.bib' file, the keys of all the entries in the
file are shown in alphabetical order in the index buffer in the top
Ebib window. (In fact, it is possible to show more than just the entry
key in this buffer. See Index Display Fields (#index-display-fields) on
how to accomplish this.) The first entry is highlighted, meaning it is
the current entry. The fields it holds and their values are shown in
the entry buffer in the bottom Ebib window. The first field is the type
field, which tells you what kind of entry you're dealing with (i.e.
`book', `article', etc.).

Below the type field, Ebib displays (up to) three sets of fields. The
first set are the so-called obligatory fields, the fields that BibTeX
requires to be filled. The second group are the optional fields, which
do not have to be filled but which BibTeX will normally add to the
bibliography if they do have a value. The third group are the so-called
additional fields. These fields are usually ignored by BibTeX (note
that BibTeX normally ignores _all_ fields it does not know), although
there are bibliography styles that treat some of these fields as
optional rather than as additional; (i.e., the `harvard' styles do
typeset the `url' field, if present.)

The first two groups of fields are different for each entry type, while
the third group are common to all entry types. You can use the
additional fields, for example, to add personal comments to the works
in your database. Ebib by default defines the following additional
fields: `crossref', `url', `annote', `abstract', `keywords', `file' and
`timestamp'. If these are not sufficient for you, you need to customise
Ebib and add your own fields. (See Additional Fields
(#additional-fields), if you need to find out how to do that.)

To move around in the index buffer, you can use the `up' and `down'
cursor keys, `C-p' and `C-n', or for those more used to mutt's key
bindings, `k' and `j'. Furthermore, `Space' and `PgDn' move a screenful
of entries down, while `b' and `PgUp' move in the other direction.
Lastly, `g' and `Home' move to the first entry, while `G' and `End'
move to the last one.

Ebib is not restricted to opening just one `.bib' file at a time. You
can open more files by just typing `o' again and entering the filename.
Ebib numbers the databases: the number of each database is shown in the
mode line of the index buffer, directly before the database name. The
keys 1-9 provide a quick way of jumping from one database to another.
Note that the numbering is dynamic: if you have three databases opened
and then close the second, database 3 becomes database 2.

With the `left' and `right' cursor keys, you can move to the previous
or next database. These keys wrap, so if you hit the `left' cursor key
while the first database is active, you move to the last database. If
you are done with a database and want to close it, type `c'. This
closes the current database. It does not leave Ebib, and all other
databases you have open will remain so.

2.1.3 Starting a New `.bib' File
--------------------------------

If you want to start a new `.bib' file from scratch, you cannot just go
and enter entries. You first have to give the database a name. So, to
start a new database, type `o' first, and give the new file a name.
Once you have done this, you can start adding entries to the database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing the Database,  Next: Saving a Database,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Basic Usage

2.2 Editing the Database
========================

Of course, being able to open and view `.bib' files is only half the
fun. One needs to be able to edit the files as well. Ebib's essential
editing facilities are discussed here.

* Editing Fields Values::
* Editing Multiline Values::
* Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Next: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.1 Adding and Deleting Entries
---------------------------------

To add an entry to a database, you type `a'. When you do this, Ebib
first asks you for an entry key, as every entry must be identified by a
unique key. Just type a name for the new entry (say `jones1998'). Since
the entry key must be unique, Ebib will complain if you enter a key
that already exists.

You can also have Ebib automatically generate entry keys: if you set
the customisation option Autogenerate Keys (#autogenerate-keys), Ebib
does not ask you for a key when you add a new entry. Instead, it
creates a temporary key (of the form `<new-entry>'). When you have
finished entering the field values for the new entry, Ebib
automatically replaces the temporary key with a key that is based on
the contents of the `author' (or `editor'), `year' and `title' fields.

Note that if you should later decide that you want to change the key of
an entry, you can do so with the command `E'. So if you have an entry
with the key `jones1998' and you want to add another entry by Jones
from 1998, you can call the new one `jones1998b' and rename the
existing one to `jones1998a'. Similarly, it is possible to let Ebib
recreate an autogenerated key by pressing `K'.

Deleting an entry is done with `d'. Be careful with this: you will be
asked for confirmation, but once you've confirmed, the entry is gone,
and it is not possible to bring it back. There is no undo in Ebib. (If
you haven't saved the database yet, it is still possible to retrieve
the deleted entry from the `.bib' file, and otherwise it may still be
in the backup file that Ebib creates. See Saving a Database
(#saving-database).)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Fields Values,  Next: Editing Multiline Values,  Prev: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.2 Editing Fields Values
---------------------------

Editing the field values for an entry is done in the lower of the two
Ebib buffers, the so-called entry buffer. You can move focus to the
entry buffer by typing the command `e' in the index buffer.

You can move between fields with the same keys that you use to move
between entries in the index buffer: the cursor keys `up' and `down',
`C-p' and `C-n', or `j' and `k'. `Space' and `PgDn' move to the next
set of fields, while `PgUp' and `b' move to the previous set of fields.
`g' and `G', and `Home' and `End' also work as expected.

Editing a field value can be done with `e'. (In fact, in the entry
buffer, `RET' is equivalent to `e'.) For most fields, Ebib simply asks
you for a string value in the minibuffer. (Here, `RET' confirms the
edit, while `C-g' cancels it.) Although BibTeX requires that field
values be surrounded by braces {} (or double quotes "", but Ebib does
not use those, even though it can of course handle them when they are
used in an existing `.bib' file) you do not need to type these. Ebib
adds them when it saves the `.bib' file.

Some fields, however, are handled in a special way. The first of these
is the `type' field: if you edit this field, you must enter one of the
predefined entry types. Ebib won't allow you to enter anything else.
You can use tab-completion in this case. Similarly, if you edit the
`crossref' field, Ebib requires that you fill in a key from the
database. Here, too, you can use tab-completion.

Note that if you're adding a new entry, Ebib automatically puts you in
the entry buffer after you've typed the entry key: you don't have to
type `e' to move to the entry buffer. When creating a new entry, it is
best to set the `type' field first, because the `type' field determines
which other fields are available for an entry.

Note also that after editing a field, Ebib (usually) puts you on the
next field. This is convenient if you're creating a new entry and need
to fill out several fields in a row.

If you're done editing the fields of the entry, type `q' to move focus
back to the index buffer. (Note: keys may have different functions in
the index buffer and the entry buffer. `q' is a typical example: in the
entry buffer, it quits editing the entry and moves focus back to the
index buffer. In the index buffer, however, `q' quits Ebib.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Multiline Values,  Next: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.3 Editing Multiline Values
------------------------------

Apart from the `type' and `crossref' field, there is another field that
Ebib handles in a special way when you edit its value. This is the
`annote' field. Most field values normally consist of a single line of
text. However, because the `annote' field is meant for creating
annotated bibliographies, it would not be very useful if you could only
write one line of text in this field. Therefore, when you edit the
`annote' field, Ebib puts you in the so-called _multiline edit buffer_.
This is essentially a text mode buffer that allows you to enter as much
text as you like. To store the text and leave the multiline edit
buffer, type `C-c | q'.

If you want to leave the multiline edit buffer without saving the text
you have just typed, type `C-c | c'. This command cancels the edit and
leaves the multiline edit buffer. The text that is stored in the field
you were editing is not altered.

Multiline values are not restricted to the `annote' field. Any field
can in fact hold a multiline value. (Except of course the `type' and
`crossref' fields.) To give a field a multiline value, use `l' instead
of `e'. You will again be put in the multiline edit buffer, where you
can edit the value. Note that you can use `l' even if a field already
has a single line value. Ebib will just make that the first line in the
multiline edit buffer.

When a field has a multiline value, only the first line is shown in the
entry buffer, for space reasons. To indicate that the value is
multiline, a plus sign `+' is placed in front of the value.

By the way, the `e' key is smart about the way an entry must be edited.
If you press `e' on a field that already has a multiline value,
regardless of the fact whether it is the `annote' field or not, Ebib
puts you in the multiline edit buffer. Therefore, you need `l' only if
you want to give a field a multiline value when it doesn't have one yet.

For more details on working with the multiline edit buffer, see The
Multiline Edit Buffer (#multiline-edit-buffer).


File: ebib.info,  Node: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Editing Multiline Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.4 Copy, Cut, Paste (Yank), and Delete
-----------------------------------------

A few more commands are available when you're in the entry buffer
editing field values. The commands `c', `x' and `y' implement a copy
and paste system: `c' copies the contents of the current field to the
kill ring, `x' kills the contents of the current field to the kill
ring, and `y' yanks (pastes) the most recently killed text in the kill
ring. You can type `y' repeatedly to get the same effect you get in
Emacs when you type `M-y' after an initial `C-y': every additional use
of `y' moves back in the kill ring.

Lastly, there is the command `d', which deletes the contents of the
current field without storing the text in the kill ring. (It asks for
confirmation, though, just to make sure.)

Note that `y' only works when the current field does not have a value
yet. This is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting a field
value. If you do want to yank text into a field that already has a
value, simply hit `d' first to delete the text.

2.3 Saving a Database
=====================

When you have undertaken any kind of editing action on a database, it
is marked as modified, which is indicated in the mode line for the
index buffer. A modified database can be saved by typing `s'. This
saves the database to the file it was loaded from without asking for
confirmation. (It is similar to `C-x C-s' in Emacs.) If you're saving a
file for the first time after loading it, Ebib creates a backup file
under the same name appended with a tilde: `<filename>.bib~'.

If you have multiple databases open, have made changes in more than one
of them, and want to save all of them without going through each
yourself, you can save all databases at once through the menu.

The menu also provides a way to save the database to another name. This
command is similar to `C-x C-w' in Emacs, so that after using it, the
new `.bib' file becomes associated with the database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Searching,  Next: LaTeX Integration,  Prev: Saving a Database,  Up: Basic Usage

2.4 Searching
=============

Ebib provides several search methods. First, if you are in the index
buffer, the normal Emacs incremental searches, `C-s' and `C-r',
function as expected. You can use them to search entry keys. Note that
once you've found the key you're searching, you must hit `RET' to quit
the search and again `RET' to make the entry you found active. Ebib
does not update the entry buffer during incremental search, as this
would be rather pointless: you're only interested in the entry you're
searching for, not in the entries you pass along the way.

Of course, it is also possible to search the database itself. If you
type `/', Ebib asks you for a search term. This can be a regular
expression, to allow for flexibility in searching. After hitting `RET',
Ebib will start searching the database (starting from the current
entry, _not_ from the first entry!) and will display the entry with the
first occurrence of the search string that it finds. All the
occurrences of the search string in that entry are highlighted.

Ebib searches all the fields of each entry. It is not possible with `/'
to specify the fields to search. Note that if the search term is found
in a field with a multiline value, Ebib will highlight the `+' sign
that it displays in front of the field value. Keep an eye out for this
when doing a search, because Ebib only shows the first line of
multiline values, and if the search term appears in another line, the
highlighted `+' is the only indication that the search term was found.
(Well, that and the fact that Ebib does _not_ say `Search string not
found', of course...)

A search term may of course appear more than once in the database. To
search for the next occurrence, type `n'. This will continue searching
for the search string in the rest of the database. Again, the first
entry found to contain the search string is displayed. Note that `n'
does not wrap: if the end of the database is reached, Ebib stops
searching. To continue searching from the top, hit `g' and then `n'.

The functions described here form Ebib's basic search functionality.
Ebib also has a much more powerful search mechanism in the form of
_virtual databases_. These are described later. (See Virtual Databases
(#virtual-databases).)


File: ebib.info,  Node: LaTeX Integration,  Next: Orgmode and markdown,  Prev: Searching,  Up: Basic Usage

2.5 LaTeX Integration
=====================

Having a BibTeX database manager running inside Emacs has an additional
advantage: it makes it trivially easy to insert BibTeX keys in your
LaTeX documents. In fact, this functionality doesn't just work with
LaTeX, but also with other text modes that have some form of citation
commands, as discussed below.

Ebib provides two functions for this. First, if you're in a LaTeX
buffer, you can call the function `ebib-insert-bibtex-key'. When you
invoke this command, Emacs prompts you for a key from the database(s)
associated with the current buffer, a citation command (that has to be
typed _without_ the backslash) and any optional argument(s) the command
allows. You can type the key using TAB-completion, and after hitting
`RET', Emacs puts a BibTeX citation at the cursor position in the
current buffer with the key you selected.

You can also do it the other way around: if you're in the index buffer
in Ebib, you can _push_ an entry to a LaTeX buffer. To do this, use the
command `p'. Ebib will ask you for a buffer to push the entry to, a
citation command and also any optional arguments, and then insert a
citation at the current cursor position in the buffer you've supplied.

The citation command that `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and the command key
`p' ask for have to be defined before you can use them. (By default,
only the `\cite' command has been predefined for LaTeX.) For details on
setting this up, see Citation Commands (#citation-commands).

Another Ebib command is available for LaTeX documents: the command
`ebib-create-bib-from-bbl' creates a `.bib' file from the `.bbl' file
associated with LaTeX document in the current buffer. This makes it
easy to create a `.bib' file containing just the BibTeX entries that
are used in the document. (One disadvantage is that cross-referenced
entries aren't always in the `.bbl' file, depending on how your BibTeX
style handles them. After using `ebib-create-bib-from-bbl' it may
therefore be necessary to check whether you have all cross-referenced
entries.)

There is another function that is available outside Ebib:
`ebib-entry-summary'. This command reads the key under the cursor in
the current buffer and displays the field values associated with that
key in a `*Help*' buffer. This allows you to quickly check a reference
in a text.

Probably the easiest way to use both `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and
`ebib-entry-summary' is to bind them to a key sequence. For example,
you could put the following in your `~/.emacs':
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
                               (local-set-key "\C-cb" 'ebib-insert-bibtex-key)))

This binds `C-c b' to the command `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in AUCTeX's
LaTeX mode. (Note that commands of the form `C-c <letter>' are reserved
for the user, and should therefore not be set by any package. For this
reasons, Ebib does not set this command automatically.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Orgmode and markdown,  Next: Consulting Databases from within a LaTeX File,  Prev: LaTeX Integration,  Up: Basic Usage

2.6 Orgmode and markdown
========================

Orgmode (http://orgmode.org) can handle various types of links and new
link types can be created by the user. If you use orgmode to write
papers and want to use bibliographic references, it is easy to set up
orgmode to use Ebib. If you add the following line to `~/.emacs':
(org-add-link-type "ebib" 'ebib)

you can create org links of the following form:
[ebib:Jones1992][Jones (1992)]

Orgmode will display this link simply as `Jones (1992)' in your buffer.
If you click this link (or press `C-c C-o' on it), you will be taken to
Ebib and shown the the entry `Jones1992' in the active database.

A citation string for orgmode is predefined, so you can use
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in orgmode buffers to insert links of the type
above into your orgmode documents.

Note that such org links aren't properly translated to LaTeX citation
commands when you export your org file. For that, you'll need to set up
a different link type for each citation command and provide functions
for exporting them to LaTeX. The orgmode documentation explains how
this is done.

Another document format that provides support for automatically
generating citations is Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
markdown. Pandoc's handling of citations is more sofisticated than
orgmode's, as it can automatically translate citations in markdown text
into LaTeX (specifically: `natbib' or `biblatex') commands, but it also
supports citations when converting to other document formats. In order
to use Ebib with Pandoc markdown, nothing needs to be set up: Ebib has
predefined citation formats for the citations forms that Pandoc
markdown supports: `text', `paren' and `year'. The `text' format
produces citations of the form `@Abney1987 [p. 50]', the `paren' format
produces `[cf. @Abney1987, p. 50]' and the `year' format, which
suppresses the author in the (LaTeX/html/what have you) output,
produces `[-@Abney1987 p. 50]'. Of these three, the `paren' type can
contain multiple citations (e.g., `[cf. @Abney1987, p. 50; @Dahl2004,
p. 204]'), which Ebib can handle as well. See Citation Commands
(#citation-commands) for further details.

2.7 Consulting Databases from within a LaTeX File
=================================================

The commands `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and `ebib-entry-summary' must
consult the database or databases loaded in Ebib, and Ebib tries to be
smart about which database(s) to consult. Usually, a LaTeX file has a
`\bibliography' command somewhere toward the end, which names the
`.bib' file or files that contain the bibliography entries. If you
consult a BibTeX database from within a LaTeX file, Ebib first looks
for a `\bibliography' command, reads the `.bib' files from it, and then
sees if those files happen to be open. If they are, Ebib uses them to
let you pick an entry key (in the case of `ebib-insert-entry-key') or
to search for the entry (in the case of `ebib-entry-summary').

Of course, it may be the case that the LaTeX file is actually part of a
bigger project, and that only the master file contains a
`\bibliography' command. To accommodate for this, Ebib checks whether
the (buffer-local) variable `TeX-master' is set to a filename. If it
is, it reads that file and tries to find the `\bibliography' command
there. (Note: `TeX-master' is an AUCTeX variable, which is used to keep
track of multi-file projects. If you don't use AUCTeX, this
functionality doesn't work, and Ebib will only check the current file
for a `\bibliography' command.)

Note that if one of the `.bib' files in the `\bibliography' command
isn't loaded, Ebib issues a warning message about this, and continues
to check for the next `.bib' file. These warning messages appear in the
minibuffer, but are probably directly overwritten again by further
messages or prompts Ebib produces, so check the `*Messages*' buffer if
Ebib doesn't seem to be able to find an entry that you're sure is in
one of your databases.

Another thing to keep in mind is that Ebib only looks for a
`\bibliography' command once: the first time either
`ebib-insert-bibtex-entry' or `ebib-entry-summary' is called. It stores
the result of this search and uses it the next time either of these
commands is used. Therefore, if you make a change to the
`\bibliography' command, you must reload the file (use `M-x
revert-buffer') to make sure Ebib rereads the `\bibliography' command.

If no `\bibliography' command is found at all, either in the LaTeX file
itself, or in the master file, Ebib simply consults the current
database, i.e. the database that was active when Ebib was lowered with
`z'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Cross-referencing,  Next: Selecting Entries,  Prev: Consulting Databases from within a LaTeX File,  Up: Basic Usage

2.8 Cross-referencing
=====================

BibTeX has a cross-referencing facility. Suppose you have an entry
`jones1998', which appeared in a book that is also in your database,
say under `miller1998'. You can tell BibTeX that `jones1998' is
contained in `miller1998' by putting `miller1998' in the `crossref'
field. When BibTeX finds such a cross-reference, all the fields of
`jones1998' that don't have a value inherit their values from
`miller1998'. At the very least, this saves you some typing, but more
importantly, if two or more entries cross-reference the same entry,
BibTeX automatically includes the cross-referenced entry in the
bibliography (and puts a reduced reference in the cross-referencing
entries).

When you fill in the `crossref' field in Ebib, Ebib displays the values
of the cross-referenced entry in the entry buffer. To indicate that
they are just inherited values, they are marked with
`ebib-crossref-face', which by default is red. (You can customise it,
of course. See the customisation option Crossref Face
(#crossref-face).) These values are just displayed for convenience:
otherwise, Ebib treats these fields as if they are empty. That is, they
cannot be edited (to edit them, you need to edit the cross-referenced
entry), and it's not possible to copy these values to the kill ring.

If you're viewing an entry that has a cross-reference and you want to
go to the cross-referenced entry you can type `F'. This command reads
the value of the `crossref' field and then displays that entry. If you
want to do the reverse, i.e., see if the current entry is
cross-referenced by any other entries, you can use the same key `F': if
you type `F' on an entry that does not have a cross-reference, Ebib
makes the key of the current entry the current search string and
searches for its first occurrence after the current entry. Note that
after Ebib has jumped to the first cross-referencing entry, you cannot
type `F' again to find the next one. This command will take you back to
the cross-referenced entry. In order to find the next cross-referencing
entry, you have to type `n', as with a normal search.

Note that if you want to use BibTeX's cross-referencing options, you
need to set the option Save Xrefs first (#save-xrefs-first). This tells
Ebib to save all entries with a `crossref' field first in the `.bib'
file. Without this, BibTeX's cross-referencing will not work reliably.

2.9 Selecting Entries
=====================

Commands in the index buffer generally operate on one single entry, or
on all entries. For some, however, it may sometimes be useful to
perform them on more than one entry, but not necessarily all of them.
This can be achieved by selecting entries. You can select the entries
you want to perform a command on with the key `m'. This selects (or
unselects) the current entry. Selected entries are displayed in inverse
video. Note that the face properties of selected entries can be
customised through the customisation option Selected Face
(#selected-face).)

Of the commands discussed so far, two can be used on selected entries:
`d' and `p'. Note, however, that it is not enough to select the entries
you want and then type any of these commands. If you do so, they will
behave as if no entries were selected. To get these commands to work on
the selected entries, you have to type a semicolon before them. That
is, `; d' deletes all selected entries, `; p' pushes all selected
entries to a LaTeX buffer. The command `m' itself can also be used with
the `;' prefix. If there are any selected entries, `; m' unselects them
all. Otherwise, `; m' selects all entries.

When using `; p' to push all selected entries to a LaTeX buffer, they
are put in a single citation command, separated by commas. Ebib does
not create a citation command for each entry separately.

2.10 Printing the Database
==========================

Sometimes it may be useful to have a `.pdf' file or print-out of your
database. Although Ebib does not actually do the printing itself, it
can create a LaTeX file for you that you can compile and print. In
fact, there are two ways of doing this.

The print options are available in the Ebib menu when the index buffer
is active. You can print the entries as index cards or as a
bibliography.

If you print your entries as a bibliography, Ebib creates a simple
LaTeX document that essentially contains a `\nocite{*}' command
followed by a `\bibliography' command referring to the `.bib' file
belonging to the current database. You can then run the usual sequence
of LaTeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX on this file, creating a document
containing a list of all the references in your database.

If you choose to print as index cards, Ebib also creates a LaTeX file.
However, instead of simply providing a `\nocite{*}' command, this file
contains a `tabular' environment for each entry in the database listing
all the fields of that entry and their values.

The entries are separated by a `\bigskip', but if you set the option
`Print Newpage' in the customisation buffer (or in the Print menu), the
entries are separated by a `\newpage', so that every entry is on a
separate page. The latter option is useful when printing actual index
cards (though you'd probably have to change the page size with the
`geometry' package as well).

By default, the index cards only show single-line field values. That
is, multiline values are normally excluded. If you want to include
multiline values in the print-out, you have to set the option `Print
Multiline' in the Options menu or in Ebib's customisation buffer. (See
The Customisation Buffer (#customisation-buffer).) With this option
set, Ebib includes all multiline values in the LaTeX file that it
creates. Note however that Ebib does not change anything about the
formatting of the text in a multiline value. So if you plan to make
(heavy) use of this option, make sure that the way you type your text
conforms to LaTeX's conventions (e.g. empty lines to mark paragraphs,
etc.) and doesn't contain any characters such as `&' that are illegal
in LaTeX. (Or, alternatively, use LaTeX code in your multiline fields.)

As mentioned, when you "print" the database, Ebib really just creates a
LaTeX file. More precisely, it creates a temporary buffer and writes
the LaTeX code into it, and then saves the contents of that buffer to a
file. After it has done that, Ebib lowers itself and instruct Emacs to
open the file in a buffer, which will then be properly set up as a
LaTeX buffer. From there you can run LaTeX and view the result.

Before doing all this, Ebib asks you which file to write to. Be careful
with this: since this is supposed to be a temporary file, Ebib simply
assumes that if you provide a filename of an existing file, it can
overwrite that file without warning!

A better way to tell Ebib which file to use is to set the option `Print
Tempfile' in Ebib's customisation buffer to some temporary file. When
this option is set, Ebib will always use this file to write to, and
will not ask you for a filename anymore.

Note that both print options operate on all entries of the database. If
there are selected entries in the database, however, only those are
printed.

There are two more customisation options for printing the database.
These are `Print Preamble' and `LaTeX Preamble'. With these options,
you can specify what Ebib should put in the preamble of the LaTeX files
it creates. Use this if you want to use specific packages (e.g.
`\usepackage{a4}' or `\usepackage{times})'. This is especially useful
for printing a bibliography, since by default, Ebib uses BibTeX's
standard bibliography style. With the option `LaTeX Preamble' you can
set your preferred bibliography style. Details are discussed in the
chapter on customisation, see The Customisation Buffer
(#customisation-buffer).

2.11 Calling a Browser
======================

With more and more scientific literature becoming available on-line, it
becomes common to store URLs and DOIs in a BibTeX database. Sometimes
you may want to load such a URL or a DOI in your browser. Ebib provides
a convenient way for doing so.

If you type `u' in the index buffer, Ebib takes the first URL stored in
the `url' field of the current entry and passes it to your browser.
Furthermore, in the entry buffer, you can use `u' on _any_ field. If
you happen to have more than one URL stored in the relevant field, and
you want to pass the second (or third, etc.) to the browser, you can
use a prefix argument. So typing `M-2 u' sends the second URL to your
browser, `M-3 u' the third, and so on.

It is not even necessary that the relevant field contains _only_ URLs.
It may contain other text mixed with the URLs: Ebib simply searches the
URLs in the field and ignores the rest of the text. Ebib considers
every string of characters that starts with `http://' or `https://' and
that does not contain whitespace or any of the characters `" ' <' or
`>' as a URL. Furthermore, Ebib regards everything that is enclosed in
a LaTeX `\url{...}' command as a URL. This behaviour is controlled by a
regular expression that can be customised. (See Url Regexp
(#url-regexp).)

Similarly, with the key `i' in the index buffer you can send a DOI to a
browser. The DOI must be stored in the `doi' field. Ulike URLs, there
can only be one DOI in this field. The whole contents of the field is
assumed to be the DOI and is sent to the browser unchanged. A DOI is
normally resolved through the URL `http://dx.doi.org/', but if you
prefer a different URL, you can customize the option Doi Url (#doi-url).

There exists an Emacs function `browse-url', which provides a nifty
interface to calling an external browser. In principle, Ebib uses this
function. However, if this function is not present on your
installation, you can set the option Browser Command (#browser-command)
to call the browser.

As just explained, if you press `u' in the index buffer, Ebib searches
the `url' field of the current entry for URLs. If you have the habit of
putting your URLs in another field, however, you may change the
customisation option Standard Url Field (#standard-url-field) and tell
Ebib to use another field for searching the URLs. The same can be done
for the DOI field.

2.12 Viewing Files
==================

If you have electronic versions of the papers in your database stored
on your computer, you can use Ebib to call external viewers for these
files. The interface for this is similar to that for calling a browser:
if you press `f' in the index buffer, Ebib searches the `file' field
for a filename and when it finds one, calls an appropriate viewer.

Just as with `u', you can use `f' in the entry buffer as well, in which
case it can be used on any field, not just the `file' field. It is also
possible to have more than one filename in a field: you can select the
one you want to view with the prefix argument.

Just as in the case of URLs, you can customise several things about the
file view functionality. The option Standard File Field
(#standard-file-field) allows you to customise the field that `f'
extracts filenames from when pressed in the index buffer. Extracting
filenames is done with a regular expression, which can be customised
through the option File Regexp (#file-regexp).

The option File Search Dirs (#file-search-dirs) allows you to tell Ebib
which directories it needs to search for files. The default value is
`~', which means Ebib just looks in your home dir. Since this is
probably not where you keep your files, you may want to customise this.
Note that you can specify more than one directory.

Note that Ebib does not search directories recursively. It is possible,
however, to put subdirectories in the filenames. That is, if you put
something like `a/abney1987.pdf' in the `file' field, Ebib searches for
the relevant file in a subdirectory `a/' of the directories listed in
the option `File Search Dirs'. (Note that if you want to do this under
Windows, you may want to remove the backslash from the file regexp.)

Ebib can call different external programs depending on the file type of
the relevant file, but you have to specify which programs to call. The
option File Associations (#file-associations) allows you to do this. By
default, `.pdf' and `.ps' files are handled, by `xpdf' and `gv',
respectively. You can specify further file types by their extensions
(do not include the dot). The program is searched for in `PATH', but
you can of course specify the full path to the program.

3 Advanced Features
*******************

The features discussed in the previous chapter should be sufficient to
get started using Ebib. However, Ebib has several more advanced
features, which are described in this chapter.

* Menu:

* Screen Layout::
* Preloading bib Files::
* @Preamble Definition::
* @String Definitions::
* Sorting the bib File::
* Merging and Importing::
* Exporting Entries::
* Timestamps::
* Multiple Identical Fields::
* Virtual Databases::
* The Multiline Edit Buffer::
* The Options Menu::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Screen Layout,  Next: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Advanced Features

3.1 Screen Layout
=================

By default, Ebib takes over the entire Emacs frame it is started in. If
you have a wide enough screen, however, it may be more convenient to
have Ebib take up only part of the frame, so that you can have the
LaTeX text you're working on and Ebib visible at the same time. The
option Layout (#layout) allows you to do this, by giving you the
ability to choose between a full-frame or a split-frame layout.

In the split-frame layout, the Ebib windows are displayed on the right
of the current frame, with the left part free for your document. In
this layout, some aspects of Ebib behave somewhat differently. Most
importantly, the multiline edit buffer is not displayed in the lower
Ebib window, but in the non-Ebib window on the left. (Obviously, after
leaving the multiline edit buffer, the original buffer is restored to
that window.)

Furthermore, pressing `z' in the index buffer leaves Ebib, but keeps
the buffers visible. You can get back to Ebib with the command `M-x
ebib' (or any key bound to it, of course), or simply by manually
switching to the index buffer. If you want to remove the Ebib buffers
from the frame but keep Ebib in the background, you can use `Z' (i.e.
uppercase `Z') in the index buffer. (Note that `Z' is also available in
the full-frame layout, but there it is identical to `z'.)

Lastly, the command `ebib-entry-summary' checks whether the Ebib
buffers are visible in the frame. If they are, it does not output the
entry info in a `*Help*' buffer, but rather displays the entry in Ebib
itself.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Preloading bib Files,  Next: @Preamble Definition,  Prev: Screen Layout,  Up: Advanced Features

3.2 Preloading `.bib' Files
===========================

Chances are that you will be doing most of your work with one or a few
`.bib' files, and you may find yourself opening the same file or files
every time you start Ebib. If so, you can tell Ebib to always load
specific `.bib' files on startup. To do this, specify the files in
Ebib's customisation buffer, under the option Preload Bib Files
(#preload-bib-files).

By default, `.bib' files are searched for in your home directory. Since
this is most likely not where you keep the files, you need to specify
either the file's full path or a relative path starting from your home
directory. Alternatively, you can customize the option Preload Bib
Search Dirs (#preload-bib-search-dirs) to specify one or more
directories in which Ebib should search the `.bib' files.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @Preamble Definition,  Next: @String Definitions,  Prev: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Advanced Features

3.3 @Preamble Definition
========================

Apart from database entries, BibTeX allows three more types of elements
to appear in a `.bib' file. These are `@comment', `@preamble' and
`@string' definitions. Ebib provides facilities to handle the latter
two. `@comment' definitions cannot be added to a `.bib' file through
Ebib, and if Ebib finds one in a `.bib' file, it is simply ignored (and
dropped from the file when you save it).

`@preamble' and `@string' definitions can be handled, however. Ebib
allows you to add one `@preamble' definition to the database. In
principle, BibTeX allows more than one such definition, but really one
suffices, because you can use the concatenation character `#' to
include multiple TeX or LaTeX commands. So, rather than having two
`@preamble' definitions such as:
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " }
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

you can write this in your `.bib' file:
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} "
         # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

Creating or editing a `@preamble' definition in Ebib is done by hitting
`P' (uppercase `P') in the index buffer. Ebib uses the multiline edit
buffer for editing the text of the `@preamble' definition, which means
that as discussed above, `C-c | q' stores the `@preamble' text and
returns focus to the index buffer, while `C-c | c' returns focus to the
index buffer while abandoning any changes you may have made. (For
details on using the multiline edit buffer, see The Multiline Edit
Buffer (#multiline-edit-buffer).)

In order to create a `@preamble' as shown above in Ebib, you only have
to type the text between the braces. Ebib takes care of including the
braces of the `@preamble' command, but otherwise it saves the text
exactly as you enter it. So in order to get the preamble above, you'd
have to type the following in Ebib:
"\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} "

Note that when Ebib loads a `.bib' file that contains more than one
`@preamble' definition, it concatenates all the strings in them in the
manner just described and saves them in one `@preamble' definition.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @String Definitions,  Next: Sorting the bib File,  Prev: @Preamble Definition,  Up: Advanced Features

3.4 @String Definitions
=======================

If you press `S' (that's a uppercase `S') in the index buffer, Ebib
hides the entry buffer in the lower window and replaces it with the
_strings buffer_. In this buffer, you can add, delete and edit
`@string' definitions.

Adding a `@string' definition is done with the command `a'. This will
first ask you for an abbreviation and then for the value to be
associated with that abbreviation. Once you've entered these, Ebib will
sort the new abbreviation into the buffer.

Moving between the `@string' definitions can be done in the usual way:
the cursor keys `up' and `down', `C-p' and `C-n' and `k' and `j' move
up and down. `Space' and `PgDn' move ten strings down, while `b' and
`PgUp' move in the other direction. The keys `g', `G', `Home' and `End'
also function as expected.

To delete a `@string' definition, use `d'. To edit the value of a
definition, use `e'. There is also a command `c', which copies the
value of the current `@string' definition to the kill ring. Unlike in
the entry buffer, there are no corresponing commands `y' and `x'. (In
fact, `x' does exist, but has another function.) Yanking from the kill
ring can be done with `C-y/M-y' in the minibuffer when you edit a
`@string''s value. Cutting a `@string''s value is pointless, because a
`@string' definition must have a value.

Having defined `@string' definitions, there must of course be a way to
use them. Just giving a field a string abbreviation as value will not
do, because Ebib puts braces around the value that you enter when it
writes the `.bib' file, so that BibTeX will not recognise the
abbreviation, and will not expand it. BibTeX will only recognise an
abbreviation if it appears in the `.bib' file outside of any braces.

To accomplish this, you must mark a field's value as _raw_. A raw field
is a field whose value is not surrounded by braces when the database is
saved, so that BibTeX recognises it as an abbreviation. To mark a field
raw, press `r'. An asterisk will appear before the field, indicating
that it is raw. Pressing `r' again will change the field back to
normal. If you press `r' on a field that does not have a value yet,
Ebib will ask you for one.

Note that this also makes it possible to enter field values that are
composed of concatenations of strings and abbreviations. The BibTeX
documentation for example explains that if you have defined:
@string{WGA = "World Gnus Almanac"}

you can create a BibTeX field like this:
title = 1966 # WGA

which will produce "1966 World Gnus Almanac". Or you can do:
month = "1~" # jan

which will produce someting like "1 January", assuming your
bibliography style has defined the abbreviation `jan'. All this is
possible with Ebib, simply by entering the exact text including quotes
or braces around the strings, and marking the relevant field as raw.

An easy way to enter a `@string' abbreviation as a field value is to
use the key `s' instead of `e'. If you type `s', Ebib asks you for a
`@string' abbreviation to put in the current field, and automatically
marks the field as raw. With this command, Ebib only accepts `@string'
definitions that are in the database, so that by using `s' you can make
sure you don't make any typos. Note that you can use tab completion to
complete a partial string.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Sorting the bib File,  Next: Merging and Importing,  Prev: @String Definitions,  Up: Advanced Features

3.5 Sorting the `.bib' File
===========================

By default, the entries in the database are saved to the `.bib' file in
alphabetical order according to entry key. If you only deal with the
`.bib' file through Ebib, you may not care in which order the entries
are saved. However, it may sometimes be desirable to be able to specify
the sort order of entries in more detail. (Apparently, this can be
useful with ConTeXt, for example.)

You can specify a sort order in Ebib's customisation buffer. To sort
the entries, you must set at least one sort level (that is, a field to
sort the entries on). You can also specify more than one sort level: if
two entries have identical values for the first sort level, they will
be sorted on the second sort level. E.g., if the first sort level is
`author' and the second is `year', then the entries are sorted by
author, and those entries that have identical values for the `author'
field are sorted by year.

A sort level is not restricted to a single field. You can specify more
fields for a single sort level. Within a single sort level, a second
sort field is used if the first sort field does not have a value. For
example, books that have an editor instead of an author will have an
empty `author' field. If you sort the database on the `author' field,
such entries will all appear at the beginning of the `.bib' file, which
is most likely not what you want.

To remedy this, you can specify both the `author' and the `editor'
fields for the first sort level. Ebib will then sort an entry on its
`author' field if it has a value, and will otherwise use the value of
the `editor' field.

The difference between two sort fields within one sort level and two
sort levels is that a second sort _field_ is an alternative for the
first field when it has no value, while a second sort _level_ is an
additional sort criterion when two or more entries cannot be sorted on
the first level, because they have identical values.

By default, the option `Sort Order' has no value, which means that the
entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to entry key. Those
that wish to customise the sort order will usually want to set the
first sort level to `author editor', and the second to `year'. In that
way, the entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to
author/editor, and entries with the same author/editor are sorted by
year.

Entries that cannot be sorted on some sort level, because the sort
fields are empty, are sorted on entry key. (Keep in mind that if the
first sort level yields _no value_ for a specific entry, Ebib does
_not_ use the second sort level to sort that entry. It uses the entry
key. The second sort level is only used if the first yields _identical_
values for two or more entries.)

Note that if you have set the option `Save Xrefs First' (see
Cross-referencing (#cross-referencing)), it is pointless to set a sort
order. Saving cross-referencing entries first messes up any sort order,
so Ebib simply ignores the sort order if `Save Xrefs First' is set.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Merging and Importing,  Next: Exporting Entries,  Prev: Sorting the bib File,  Up: Advanced Features

3.6 Merging and Importing
=========================

As described in the previous chapter, adding entries to a database can
be done manually with the key `a'. There are other ways of adding
entries to a database, however.

In the index buffer, the Ebib menu has an option to merge a second .bib
file into the current database. Ebib reads the entries in this file and
adds them to the database. Duplicate entries (that is, entries with an
entry key that already exists in the database) will not be loaded. Ebib
logs a warning about each duplicate entry to its log buffer and
displays a warning after loading the `.bib' file when this happens.

Another way to add entries to a database is to import them from an
Emacs buffer. If, for example, you find ready-formatted BibTeX entries
in a text file or e.g. on the internet, you can copy & paste them to
any Emacs buffer (e.g. the `*scratch*' buffer), and then execute the
command `M-x ebib-import'. Ebib then goes through the buffer and loads
all BibTeX entries it finds into the current database (i.e. the
database that was active when you lowered Ebib). If you call
`ebib-import' while the region is active, Ebib only reads the BibTeX
entries in the region.

3.7 Exporting Entries
=====================

Sometimes it can be useful to copy entries from one database to
another, or to create a new `.bib' file with several entries from an
existing database. For this purpose, Ebib provides exporting
facilities. To export an entry to a `.bib' file, use the command `x'.
Ebib will ask you for a filename to export the entry to. (If you have
already exported an entry before, Ebib will present the filename you
used as default, but you can of course change it.)

For obvious reasons, Ebib appends the entry to the file that you enter
if it already exists, it does not overwrite the file. If this is not
what you want, delete the file first, as Ebib provides no way to do
this.

If you have more than one database open in Ebib, it is also possible to
copy entries from one database to another. To do this, use the `x'
command with a numeric prefix argument. E.g., if the database you want
to export an entry to is the second database, type `M-2 x' to export
the current entry to it. The number of the database is given in the
modeline of the index buffer.

If the database you're copying an entry to already contains an entry
with the same entry key, Ebib won't copy the entry, and issues an
appropriate warning message.

Note that the command `x' can operate on selected entries. So to export
several entries in one go select them and type `; x'. You can use a
prefix argument in the normal way: `M-2 ; x' exports the selected
entries to database 2.

Apart from entries, it is also possible to export the `@preamble' and
`@string' definitions. The `@preamble' definition is exported with the
command `X' in the index buffer. `@string' definitions can be exported
in the strings buffer: `x' in this buffer exports the current string,
while `X' exports all `@string' definitions in one go. All these
commands function in the same way: when used without a prefix argument,
they ask for a filename, and then append the relevent data to that
file. With a numeric prefix argument, they copy the relevant data to
the corresponding open database.

3.8 Timestamps
==============

Ebib provides the possibility to add a timestamp to every new entry,
recording the time it was added to the database. The timestamp is
recorded in the (additional) field `timestamp'. (By default, this field
is not shown, but you can make it visible by checking the option "Show
Hidden Fields" in the Options menu.)

You can tell Ebib to create timestamps by setting the option `Use
Timestamp' in Ebib's customisation buffer. With this option set, a
timestamp is included in entries added to the database with `a'. Ebib
will also add a timestamp to entries imported from a buffer or merged
from a file, and to entries exported to another database or to a file.
When importing or exporting entries, existing timestamps will be
overwritten. The logic behind this is that the timestamp records the
date and time when the entry was added to the database, not when it was
first created.

Note that if this option is unset, the timestamp of an entry is
retained when it's imported or exported. Therefore, if you record
timestamps and want to im-/export entries without changing their
timestamps, temporarily unset this option.

Ebib uses the function `format-time-string' to create the timestamp.
The format string that Ebib uses can be customised in Ebib's
customisation buffer. The default string is `"%a %b' `%e %T %Y"', which
produces a timestamp of the form `"Mon Mar 12 01:03:26 2007"'.
Obviously, this string is not suited for sorting, so if you want to be
able to sort on timestamps, you'll need to customise the format string.
See the documentation for `format-time-string' on the options that are
available.

3.9 Multiple Identical Fields
=============================

Under normal circumstances, a BibTeX entry only contains one occurrence
of each field. If BibTeX notices that an entry contains more than one
occurrence of an obligatory or optional field, it issues a warning.
Ebib is somewhat less gracious, it simply takes the value of the last
occurrence without giving any warning. (Note, by the way, that BibTeX
will use the value of the _first_ occurrence, not the last.) When
additional fields appear more than once in an entry, BibTeX does not
warn you, since it ignores those fields anyway. Here, too, Ebib's
standard behaviour is to ignore all but the last value.

However, some online reference management services "use" this feature
of BibTeX in that they put multiple `keywords' fields in the BibTeX
entries that they produce. If you were to import such an entry into
Ebib, you would lose all your keywords except the last one. To remedy
this, you can tell Ebib that it should allow multiple occurrences of a
single field in a BibTeX entry. You can do this by setting the
customisation option Allow Identical Fields (#allow-identical-fields).

With this option set, Ebib collapses the multiple occurrences into a
single occurrence. All the values of the different occurrences are
collected and stored in the single occurrence, separated by semicolons.
That is, Ebib does not retain the multiple occurrences, but it does
retain the values. So suppose you have an entry that contains the
following `keywords' fields:
@book{jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep},
    keywords = {winter},
    keywords = {hybernation}
}

If you load this entry into Ebib with the option `Allow Identical
Fields' set, you will get the following:
@book{jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep; winter; hybernation}
}

3.10 Virtual Databases
======================

In the previous chapter, Ebib's basic search functionality was
discussed. (See Searching (#searching).) Ebib also provides a much more
sophisticated search and filtering mechanism in the form of _virtual
databases_.

A virtual database is a database that is not associated with any `.bib'
file. Rather, it is created from another database by selecting entries
from it based on a specific search pattern, called a _filter_. This
allows you, for example, to select all entries from a database that
contain the string "Jones" in their `author' field. A filter can be as
complex as you want: you can select all entries that do _not_ contain
"Jones" in the `author' field, or all entries that contain "Jones" in
either the `author' or the `editor' field, or all entries that contain
"Jones" in the `author' field, and "symbiotic hybernation" in the
`keyword' field, etc. Basically, the filter can consist of an arbitray
number of search criteria combined with the logical operators `and, or'
and `not'.

* Complex Filters::
* Properties of Virtual Databases::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Selection,  Next: Complex Filters,  Up: Virtual Databases

3.10.1 Simple Selection
-----------------------

Creating a virtual database is simple: press `&', and Ebib will ask you
for a field to select on, and for a regular expression to select with.
So if you want to select all entries that contain "Jones" in the
`author' field, you press `&' and type `author' as the field and
`Jones' as the regexp to filter on.

Ebib will then create a virtual database containing the entries
matching your selection criterion. A virtual database has the same name
as the database it is based on, prepended with `V:'. It also has a
number like any other database, and you can move back and forth to
other databases with the number or cursor keys.

If you don't want to filter on one specific field but rather want to
select all entries that match a certain regexp in any field, you can
type `any' as the field to filter on. So specifying `any' as the field
and `Jones' as the regexp, the virtual database will select all entries
that have a field that contains "Jones" in them.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Complex Filters,  Next: Properties of Virtual Databases,  Prev: Simple Selection,  Up: Virtual Databases

3.10.2 Complex Filters
----------------------

Once you have a virtual database, it remains associated with the
database it was created from. This means that you can refine or extend
the selection (i.e. the filter) that the virtual database is based on.
If, in the current example, you want to include all the entries that
have "Jones" in the `editor' field, you have to perform a logical `or'
operation: you want to select an entry if it contains "Jones" in the
`author' field (which you already did) _or_ if it contains "Jones" in
the `editor' field.

A short sidenote: the first impulse in a case like this might be to use
`and' instead of `or': after all, you want to select all entries that
contain "Jones" in the `author' field _and_ all entries that contain
"Jones" in the `editor' field. However, the filter that you build up is
used to test each entry _individually_ whether it meets the selection
criterion. An entry meets the criterion if it contains "Jones" in the
`author' field _or_ if it contains "Jones" in the `editor' field.
Therefore, `or' is the required operator in this case. If you would use
`and', you would only get those entries that contain "Jones" in both
the `author' _and_ `editor' fields.

To perform a logical `or' operation, press the key `|'. As before, you
will be asked which field you want to filter on, and which regexp you
want to filter with. Ebib will then update the virtual database with
all entries in the original database that match the additional
criterion.

It is also possible to perform a logical `and' on the virtual database.
Use this if you want to select those entries that contain "Jones" in
the `author' field and e.g. "symbiotic hybernation" in the `keyword'
field. A logical `and' operation is done with the key `&'. (Note: this
is the same key that is used to create a virtual database. In fact, you
can also create a virtual database with `|': when used in a normal
database, `&' and `|' are equivalent. They are only different in
virtual databases.)

Both the `&' and `|' commands can be used with the negative prefix
argument `M--' (or `C-u -', which is identical). In this case, the
search criterion is negated. That is, the negative prefix argument
performs a logical `not' operation on the search criterion.

That is, if you want to select all entries from a database that do
_not_ contain "Jones" in the `author' field, you can do this by typing
`M-- &' and then filling out the relevant field and regexp. This prefix
argument is available both in real and in virtual databases.

There is another way of performing a logical `not' operation, which is
only available in virtual databases: by pressing the key `~', you
invert the current filter. That is, if you have a virtual database with
all the entries containing "Jones" in the `author' or in the `editor'
field, and you press `~', the selection is inverted, and now contains
all entries that do _not_ have "Jones" in the `author' or `editor'
field.

Although `~' and the negative prefix argument to `&' or `|' both
perform logical `not' operations, they are _not_ equivalent: `~'
negates the entire filter built up so far, while the negative prefix
argument only negates the single selection criterion you enter with it.

If you want to know what the filter for the current virtual database is
exactly, you can type `V'. This command displays the current filter in
the minibuffer. The filter is specified as a Lisp expression, meaning
that the operators appear before their operands, not in between them.
That is, `x and y' is written as `(and x y)'.

With a prefix argument (any prefix argument will do), the command `V'
not only displays the current filter, but also reapplies it. This can
be useful when you've made changes to the source database: Ebib does
not automatically update a virtual database when its source database is
modified.

3.10.3 Properties of Virtual Databases
--------------------------------------

Virtual databases differ from normal databases in several ways. First,
they cannot be modified: you cannot add or delete entries, and you
cannot modify the contents of fields. It is also not possible to import
entries to them or merge another file with them. Furthermore, it is not
possible to export entries to them or from them.

A virtual database cannot be saved in the normal way with `s', and the
menu option to save all databases ignores virtual databases. If you
want to save a virtual database, you can use the command `w'. This
command not only saves the virtual database, it also changes it into a
normal database, and detaches it from its original source database, so
that you can modify it without affecting the source database.

The print bibliography command also doesn't work with virtual
databases. The reason for this is that the virtual database is not
associated with an actual `.bib' file, so there is no file to create a
list of references from. However, it is possible to print index cards
frm a virtual database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: The Multiline Edit Buffer,  Next: The Options Menu,  Prev: Virtual Databases,  Up: Advanced Features

3.11 The Multiline Edit Buffer
==============================

As mentioned several times before, Ebib has a special multiline edit
buffer, which is used to edit field values that contain newlines
(so-called _multiline fields_), and also to edit the contents of the
`@preamble' command. This section discusses the details of this buffer.

Ebib enters multiline edit mode in one of three cases: when you edit
the `@preamble' definition, when you hit `l' in the entry buffer to
edit the current field as multiline, or when you hit `e' on the
`annote' field, or on a field whose value already is multiline.

The mode that is used in the multiline edit buffer is
user-configurable. The default value is `text-mode', but if you prefer
to use some other mode, you can specify this through the customisation
options. (Personally, I use `markdown-mode' in the multiline edit
buffer, so that I can use `markdown'
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write annotations,
which provides an easy way to create headers, use bold and italic,
etc., in plain text.)

Three commands are relevant for interacting with Ebib when you're in
the multiline edit buffer, which are bound to key sequences in the
minor mode ebib-multiline-edit-mode, which is activated automatically
in the multiline edit buffer.

`ebib-quit-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | q', leaves the multiline
edit buffer and stores the text in the database. If you invoke this
command when you've deleted all contents of the buffer (including the
final newline!) and you were editing a field value or the `@preamble',
the field value or preamble is deleted. (This is in fact the _only_ way
to delete the `@preamble' definition. Field values on the other hand
can also be deleted by hitting `x' or `d' on them in the entry buffer.)
If you were editing a `@string' value, Ebib will just complain, because
string definitions cannot be empty.

`ebib-cancel-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | c', also leaves the
multiline edit buffer, but it does so without storing the text. The
original value of the field, string or preamble will be retained. If
the text was modified, Ebib will ask for a confirmation before leaving
the buffer.

`ebib-save-from-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | s', can be used in the
multiline edit buffer to save the database. This command first stores
the text in the database and then saves it. Because Ebib does not do an
autosave of the current database, it is advisable to save the database
manually every now and then to prevent data loss in case of crashes. It
would be annoying to have to leave the multiline edit buffer every time
you want to do this, so this command has been provided to allow you to
do this from within the buffer.

It is possible to change the second key of these commands, if you find
`|' inconvenient. See Modifying Key Bindings (#modifying-key-bindings)
for details.

3.12 The Options Menu
=====================

In the index buffer, Ebib's menu has an Options submenu. This menu
gives you quick access to Ebib's customisation buffer, and it also
provides checkboxes for several settings that can be toggled on and
off. All of these settings have defaults that can be defined in the
customisation buffer. Setting or unsetting them in the Options menu
only changes them for the duration of your Emacs session, it doesn't
affect the default setting.

The same is true for the printing options that are in the Print menu.
When set or unset in the menu, the default values specified in the
customisation buffer do not change.

5 Customisation
***************

Ebib can be customised through Emacs' standard customisation interface.
The only thing that cannot be customised in this way are the key
bindings. If you wish to customise those, you have to use the file
`~/.ebibrc'.

5.1 The Customisation Buffer
============================

Ebib's customisation group is a subgroup of the `Tex' group. It can be
invoked by typing `M-x' `customize-group' `RET' `ebib' `RET', or going
to the Options menu and selecting "Customize Ebib". This chapter gives
a short description of all the options available in the customisation
buffer.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Default Type,  Next: Preload Bib Files,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.1 Default Type
------------------

*Default value*: `article'.
The default type is the default entry type given to a new entry. Every
entry in the Ebib database must have a type, because the type defines
which fields are available. When a new entry is created, Ebib gives it
a default type, which can be customised through this option.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Preload Bib Files,  Next: Preload Bib Search Dirs,  Prev: Default Type,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.2 Preload Bib Files
-----------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
This option allows you to specify which file(s) Ebib is to load when it
starts up. Specify one file per line, press the `INS' button to add
more files. You can complete a partial filename with `M-TAB'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Preload Bib Search Dirs,  Next: Additional Fields,  Prev: Preload Bib Files,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.3 Preload Bib Search Dirs
-----------------------------

*Default value*: `~'.
This is a list of directories Ebib searches for `.bib' files to be
preloaded. Note that only the directories themselves are searched, not
their subdirectories.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Additional Fields,  Next: Layout,  Prev: Preload Bib Search Dirs,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.4 Additional Fields
-----------------------

*Default value*: `crossref' `url' `annote' `abstract' `keywords' `file'
`timestamp'.
The additional fields are those fields that are available for all entry
types, and which BibTeX generally ignores. This option allows you to
specify which additional fields you wish to use in your database.
Specify one field per line, press the `INS' button to add more fields.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Layout,  Next: Width,  Prev: Additional Fields,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.5 Layout
------------

*Default value*: `full'.
When set to `full', Ebib takes over the entire frame when it runs.
Alternatively, you can select `custom', so that you can specify the
width of the Ebib windows yourself. In this case, Ebib takes up the
right part of the frame, leaving the left part free. See Screen Layout
(#screen-layout) for details.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Width,  Next: Index Window Size,  Prev: Layout,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.6 Width
-----------

*Default value*: 80.
The width of the Ebib windows when `ebib-layout' is set to `custom'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Index Window Size,  Next: Index Display Fields,  Prev: Width,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.7 Index Window Size
-----------------------

*Default value*: 10.
This option lets you specify the size of the index window at the top of
the Ebib screen.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Index Display Fields,  Next: Uniquify Keys,  Prev: Index Window Size,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.8 Index Display Fields
--------------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
This option allows you to specify fields that should be displayed next
to the entry key in the index buffer. By default, the index buffer only
shows the key of each entry, but if this is too little information, you
can use this option to display e.g. the title of each entry as well.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Uniquify Keys,  Next: Autogenerate Keys,  Prev: Index Display Fields,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.9 Uniquify Keys
-------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
When you add a new entry to the database or when Ebib autogenerates a
key (when Autogenerate Keys (#autogenerate-keys) is set), a check is
made to make sure that the new key doesn't already exist in the
database. If it does, Ebib normally aborts the operation but when this
option is set, Ebib instead tries to create a unique key by appending
`b' or `c', etc. to it.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Autogenerate Keys,  Next: Citation Commands,  Prev: Uniquify Keys,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.10 Autogenerate Keys
------------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
This option specifies whether Ebib should autogenerate keys or not. If
set, adding a new entry will not ask for a key. Instead, a temporary
key `<new-entry>' is used. When you leave the entry buffer, this key is
replaced with an autogenerated key.

Ebib uses the function `bibtex-generate-autokey' to generate the key.
This function has a number of customisation options, which are
described in its documentation string.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Citation Commands,  Next: Multiline Major Mode,  Prev: Autogenerate Keys,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.11 Citation Commands
------------------------

*Default value*:
((any
  (("cite" "\\cite%<[%A]%>{%K}")))
 (org-mode
  (("ebib" "[ebib:%K][%A]")))
 (markdown-mode
  (("text" "@%K%< [%A]%>")
   ("paren" "[%(%<%A %>@%K%<, %A%>%; )]")
   ("year" "[-@%K%< %A%>]"))))

With the command `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' or with the command key `p'
in the index buffer, you can insert a BibTeX key into a LaTeX buffer.
This option allows you to define the commands that are available
through tab completion when these functions ask for a citation command.

Citation commands are defined for specific major modes or for all modes
(under the heading `any'). Each command consists of an identifier,
which you type when Ebib prompts you for a citation command, plus a
format string. This format string can contain a few directives, which
are used to add the citation key and any optional arguments. This
format string can contain the following directives:

`%K'
     the entry key to be inserted.

`%A'
     an argument, for which the user is prompted.

`%<...%>'
     optional material surrounding a `%A' directive.

`%(...%<sep>)'
     a so-called _repeater_, which contains material that can be
     repeated. If present, the repeater must contain the entry key
     directive `%K'.

In the simplest case, the format string contains just a `%K' directive:
`\cite{%K}'. In this case, `%K' is replaced with the citation key and
the result inserted. Usually, however, citation commands allow for
optional arguments that are formatted as pre- or postnotes to the
citation. For example, using the `natbib' package, you have citation
commands available of the form:
\citet[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}

In order to be able to insert such citations, the format string must
contain `%A' directives:
\citet[%A][%A]{%K}

With such a format string, Ebib asks the user to provide text for the
two arguments and inserts it at the locations specified by the
directives. Of course, it is possible to leave the arguments empty (by
just hitting `RET'). With the format string above, this would yield the
following citation in the LaTeX buffer:
\citet[][]{Jones1992}

This is completely harmless, because LaTeX will simply ignore the empty
arguments. However, you may prefer for the brackets not to appear if
the arguments are empty. In that case, you can wrap the brackets and
the `%A' directives in a `%<...%>' pair:
\citet%<[%A]%>%<[%A]%>{%K}

Now, if you leave the arguments empty, Ebib produces the following
citation:
\citet{Jones1992}

Note however, that in this case there is in fact one problem associated
with this format string. If you fill out the first argument but not the
second, Ebib produces the wrong format string:
\citet[cf.]{Jones1992}

If only one optional argument is provided, `natbib' assumes that it is
a postnote, while what you intended is actually a prenote. Therefore,
it is best not to make the second argument optional:
\citet%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}

This way, the second pair of brackets is always inserted, regardless of
whether you provide a second argument or not.

`Natbib' commands also accept multiple citation keys. When you call
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' from within a LaTeX buffer, you can only
provide one key, but when you're in Ebib, you can mark multiple entry
keys and then use `; p' to push them to a buffer. In this case, Ebib
asks you for a separator and then inserts all keys into the position of
`%K':
\citet{Jones1992,Haddock2004}

It is, however, also possible to specify in the format string that a
certain sequence can be repeated and how the different elements should
be separated. This is done by wrapping that portion of the format
string that can be repeated in a `%(...%)' pair. Normally, you'll want
to provide a separator, which is done by placing it between the `%' and
the closing `)':
\citet[%A][%A]{%(%K%,)}

This format string says that the directive `%K' can be repeated and
that multiple keys must be separated with a comma. The advantage of
this is that you are no longer asked to provide a separator. However,
this is not the only thing one can do, because it is also possible to
put `%A' directives in the repeating part. This is useful for the
`biblatex' package. `Biblatex' has so-called _multicite_ commands,
which take the following form:
\footcites[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}[][p. 201]{Haddock2004}

Multicite commands can take more than one citation key in braces `{}'
and each of those citation keys can take two optional arguments in
brackets `[]'. In order to get such citations, you can provide the
following format string:
\footcites%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

Here, the entire sequence of two optional arguments and the obligatory
citation key is wrapped in `%(...%)', so that Ebib knows it can be
repeated. If you now mark multiple entries in Ebib, press `; p' and
select the `footcites' command, Ebib will put all the keys in the
citation, asking you for two arguments for each citation key.

Of course it is also possible to combine parts that are repeated with
parts that are not repeated. In fact, that already happens in the
previous example, because the part `\footcites' is not repeated. But
the part that is not repeated may contain `%A' directives as well:
\footcites%<(%A)%>(%A)%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

Multicite commands in `biblatex' take two additional arguments
surrounded with parentheses. These are pre- and postnotes for the
entire sequence of citations. They can be accommodated as shown.

The function `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' can of course also be called from
non-LaTeX buffers. For example, org-mode (http://orgmode.org) can use
bibliographic links, and so can Pandoc
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) markdown. For those two modes,
citation commands have been predefined, which may provide some
additional inspiration in case you want to create your own format
strings.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Multiline Major Mode,  Next: Sort Order,  Prev: Citation Commands,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.12 Multiline Major Mode
---------------------------

*Default value*: `text-mode'.
This specifies the major mode used in the multiline edit buffer. Note
that the value _must_ be a command for a major mode.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Sort Order,  Next: Save Xrefs First,  Prev: Multiline Major Mode,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.13 Sort Order
-----------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
The use of this option is explained above, see Sorting the .bib file
(#sorting-bib-file). To create a sort order, click the `INS' button to
create a sort level, and then click the `INS' button under that sort
level to enter a sort field. If you want to add more than one sort
field to the sort level, simply hit `INS' again.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Save Xrefs First,  Next: Crossref Face,  Prev: Sort Order,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.14 Save Xrefs First
-----------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
For cross-referencing to work, the cross-referencing entries must
appear in the `.bib' file _before_ the cross-referenced entries. In
order to tell Ebib to save all entries with a `crossref' field first,
you must set the option `Save Xrefs First' in Ebib's customisation
buffer. With this option set, BibTeX's crossreferencing options work as
intended.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Crossref Face,  Next: Selected Face,  Prev: Save Xrefs First,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.15 Crossref Face
--------------------

*Default value*: `((t (:foreground "red")))'.
Field values inherited from a cross-referenced entry are marked with
this face. By default, the face has red as foreground colour.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Selected Face,  Next: Use Timestamp,  Prev: Crossref Face,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.16 Selected Face
--------------------

*Default value*:
`((t (:inverse-video t)))'
When entries are selected (with `m'), they are highlighted in this
face. By default, it uses the text property `highlight'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Use Timestamp,  Next: Timestamp Format,  Prev: Selected Face,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.17 Use Timestamp
--------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
If this option is set, Ebib will add a `timestamp' field to every new
entry, recording the date and time it was added to the database. See
Timestamps (#timestamps).


File: ebib.info,  Node: Timestamp Format,  Next: Standard Url Field,  Prev: Use Timestamp,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.18 Timestamp Format
-----------------------

*Default value*: `"%a %b %e %T %Y"'.
This option specifies the format string that is used to create the
timestamp. The format string is used by `format-time-string' to create
a time representation. The default value produces a timestamp of the
form `"Mon Mar 12 01:03:26 2007"'. See the documentation for the Emacs
function `format-time-string' for the forms that the format string can
take.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Standard Url Field,  Next: Url Regexp,  Prev: Timestamp Format,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.19 Standard Url Field
-------------------------

*Default value*: `url'.
This is the field that Ebib searches for URLs if you press `u' in the
index buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Url Regexp,  Next: Browser Command,  Prev: Standard Url Field,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.20 Url Regexp
-----------------

*Default value*: `\\url{\(.*\)}\|https?://[^ '<>\"\n\t\f]+'.
This is the regular expression that Ebib uses to search for URLs in a
field. With the default value, Ebib considers everything that is in a
LaTeX `\url{...}' command as a URL, and furthermore every string of
text that starts with `http://' or `https://' and does not contain
whitespace or one of the characters `' " <' or `>'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Browser Command,  Next: Standard Doi Field,  Prev: Url Regexp,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.21 Browser Command
----------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
If this option is unset, Ebib uses the Emacs function `browse-url' to
start a browser. If this function does not exist, you can set this
option. For example, if you use the Firefox browser, set this option to
`firefox'.

For this to work, the browser that you use must be able to handle a URL
on the command line.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Standard Doi Field,  Next: Doi Url,  Prev: Browser Command,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.22 Standard Doi Field

The URL used to open a DOI. It must contain exactly one instance fo
`%s', which will be replaced with the DOI.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Standard File Field,  Next: File Associations,  Prev: Doi Url,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.24 Standard File Field

*Default value*: `file'.
This is the field that Ebib searches for filenames if you press `f' in
the index buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: File Associations,  Next: File Regexp,  Prev: Standard File Field,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.25 File Associations
------------------------

*Default value*: `(("pdf" . "xpdf") ("ps" . "gv"))'.
The programs used to view files. By default, programs for `.pdf' and
`.ps' files are specified, which should be available on most linux
systems. If you prefer other programs or are running on Windows, you
can specify them here. Note that Ebib searches the PATH for the
programs, but you can also specify full path names. Of course, it is
also possible to add new associations.

Note that GNU/Emacs 23 comes with `doc-view-mode', which provides a way
to view `.pdf' and `.ps' files inside Emacs. (The files are converted
to `.png' format first.) If you prefer to use this mode, simply leave
the program field blank for the relevant file type.


File: ebib.info,  Node: File Regexp,  Next: File Search Dirs,  Prev: File Associations,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.26 File Regexp
------------------

*Default value*: `[^?|\:*<>\" \n\t\f]+'.
Regural expression used to find files in a field. The default value
essentially means that every string of characters not containing any of
the characters `? | \ : * < > "' or space, newline, tab of formfeed is
recognised as a file name.

Note that URLs can easily by recognised by the prefix `http:', but
recognising files is not so straightforward. It is therefore not
advisable to put anything but filenames in the `file' field.


File: ebib.info,  Node: File Search Dirs,  Next: Print Preamble,  Prev: File Regexp,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.27 File Search Dirs
-----------------------

*Default value*: `~'.
List of directories that Ebib searches for files. Note that searching
is not recursive: only the files listed here are searched, not their
subdirectories.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Print Preamble,  Next: Print Newline,  Prev: File Search Dirs,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.28 Print Preamble
---------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
This option specifies the preamble that is to be added to the LaTeX
file Ebib creates for printing the database as index cards. You can set
your own `\usepackage' commands, or anything else you may need.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Print Newline,  Next: Print Multiline,  Prev: Print Preamble,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.29 Print Newline
--------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
With this option set, Ebib puts every entry on a separate page when
printing index cards. When this option is unset, the entries are
separated by a small amount of whitespace only.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Print Multiline,  Next: Latex Preamble,  Prev: Print Newline,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.30 Print Multiline
----------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
When this options is set, Ebib includes multiline field values when you
print index cards. When unset, multiline values are excluded, which
saves space.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Latex Preamble,  Next: Print Tempfile,  Prev: Print Multiline,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.31 Latex Preamble
---------------------

*Default value*: `\bibliographystyle{plain}'.
This option specifies the preamble to be added to the LaTeX file for
creating a list of references from the database. The default is to use
the `plain' style, but you may want to specify your own BibTeX packages
and options.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Print Tempfile,  Next: Allow Identical Fields,  Prev: Latex Preamble,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.32 Print Tempfile
---------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
This option specifies the name and location of the temporary file Ebib
creates with the commands `ebib-print-database' and
`ebib-latex-database'. When unset, Ebib will ask for a filename each
time either of these commands is called.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Allow Identical Fields,  Next: Entry Types,  Prev: Print Tempfile,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.33 Allow Identical Fields
-----------------------------

*Default value*: `nil'.
If this option is set, Ebib stores the values of multiple occurrences
of a single field within an entry in a single occurrence of that field,
separated by semicolons (see Multiple Identical Fields
(#multiple-identical-fields)).


File: ebib.info,  Node: Entry Types,  Prev: Allow Identical Fields,  Up: The Customisation Buffer

5.1.34 Entry Types
------------------

*Default value*: see below.
This option allows you to customise the entry types that Ebib uses.
Each entry type has a name, a set of obligatory fields and a set of
optional fields. You can add, alter or delete single fields in an entry
type, or whole entry types.

If you want to add an entry type, hit the `INS' key on the top level
and give the new entry a name, then add obligatory and/or optional
fields. It is not necessary that an entry type has both obligatory and
optional fields, you can define an entry that has only obligatory or
only optional fields.

The default entry types and fields are the following:
 article                                               ;; name of entry type
   author title journal year                           ;; obligatory fields

File: ebib.info,  Node: Modifying Key Bindings,  Prev: The Customisation Buffer,  Up: Customisation

5.2 Modifying Key Bindings
==========================

If you are unhappy about Ebib's standard key bindings and would like to
change them, or if you would like to bind a command that is only
available through the menu to a key, you can do so by creating a file
`~/.ebibrc' and writing your preferred key bindings in it. A key
binding definition is built up as follows:
(ebib-key <buffer> <key> <command>)

`<buffer>' is either `index', `entry' or `strings', for the
corresponding buffer. `<key>' is a standard Emacs key description, and
`<command>' is the Ebib command to be associated with the key. The
commands that can be used here are listed in The Ebib Buffers
(#ebib-buffers). Note that it is possible to bind more than one key to
a single function: just add as many `ebib-key' statements as necessary.

As an example, the following binds `C-s' to `ebib-search' in the index
buffer, so that the database can be searched with `C-s' as well as with
`/':
(ebib-key index "\C-s" ebib-search)

If you want to unbind a key, you can simply leave out `<command>'. So
if you want to bind the command `ebib-delete-entry' to `D' rather than
`d', you need to put the following in `.ebibrc':
(ebib-key index "D" ebib-delete-entry)
(ebib-key index "d")

The first line binds `D' to the command `ebib-delete-entry'. The second
line unbinds `d'.

If a command can be called with a prefix key (as for example
`ebib-delete-entry' can), `ebib-key' will automatically rebind the
prefixed version as well. So in the example above, the first line not
only binds `D', it also binds `; D'. Similarly, the second line not
only unbinds `d', but also `; d'.

Note that if you bind the print commands to a key (`ebib-print-entries'
and `ebib-latex-entries') they are automatically set up to accept the
prefix key as well.

It is also possible to redefine the prefix key itself. To do this, you
must specify `select-prefix' for `<buffer>'. The value of `<command>'
is irrelevant here, so it can be left out:
(ebib-key select-prefix ":")

This sets up `:' as the new prefix key. Doing this automatically
unbinds the existing prefix key.

As a final option, `ebib-key' allows you to redefine the second key in
the key bindings of the multiline edit buffer:
(ebib-key multiline "&")

This piece of code changes the commands `C-c | q', `C-c | c' and `C-c |
s' to `C-c & q', `C-c & c' and `C-c & s', respectively.
