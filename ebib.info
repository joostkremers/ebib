Ebib Manual
***********

Ebib is a program with which you can manage BibTeX and BibLateX database
files without having to edit the raw ‘.bib’ files.  It runs in
GNU/Emacs, version 24.3 or higher.  (Users of GNU/Emacs 23.1 and up can
install Ebib 1.x, which is available in the pasture branch on Github or
as a zip or tar archive on Github’s releases page.)

   It should be noted that Ebib is _not_ a minor or major mode for
editing BibTeX files.  It is a program in itself, which just happens to
make use of Emacs as a working environment, in the same way that for
example Gnus is.

1.1 Version 2.12, August 2018
=============================

   • Add an option to specify the default sort field and direction.  It
     is no longer necessary to set the desired sort field as the first
     column in the index buffer, but Ebib still defaults to this if the
     default sort field and direction are not set explicitly.

1.2 Version 2.11.12, July 2018
==============================

   • Use BibLaTeX’s ‘Date’ field, if present, for displaying the year.
   • Check for changed files on disk when saving all databases, not just
     when saving the current database.
   • Improve handling of multiple databases: ‘crossref’ entries can now
     occur in other open databases as well, and searches with ‘/’ can be
     continued in other databases.
   • Autogenerating keys is now on by default.

1.5 Version 2.9, January 2017
=============================

   • Allow ‘%s’ in the program strings in ‘ebib-file-associations’,
     making it possible to pass command line arguments to the program
     being called.

1.6 19 December 2016
====================

   • Remove support for a separate rc file for Ebib.  User configuration
     should be moved to Emacs’ ‘init.el’ file.  To keep Ebib
     customisation in a separate file, simply load it from ‘init.el’.
   • The macro ‘ebib-key’ has also been removed.  Simply use
     ‘define-key’ or any other key binding mechanism to define keys for
     Ebib.  See the section *note Modifying Key Bindings:
     #modifying-key-bindings. for details.

1.8 5 December 2016
===================

   • New library ‘org-ebib’.  This defines a new Org link type ‘ebib:’,
     which uses the command ‘org-ebib-open’ to open Ebib.  The previous
     commands to do this, ‘ebib-show-entry’ and ‘ebib-open-org-link’
     have been removed.  ‘org-ebib’ also allows the creation of Org
     links to Ebib entries with ‘org-store-link’.
   • New citation insertion command ‘ebib-insert-citation’.  This
     replaces ‘ebib-insert-bibtex-key’, so please update your key
     bindings.  The new command uses ‘ivy’ for completion if this
     package is available, so that it is possible to select an entry by
     typing parts of its author and/or title.

1.9 7 November 2016
===================

   • New tabulated list interface in index buffer.  This interface is
     not based on Emacs’ built-in ‘tabulated-list-mode’, hence sorting
     cannot be done by clicking on the column headers.  Sorting can be
     done with ‘<’, ‘>’ (sort ascending and sort descending,
     respectively, which ask for the column to sort) and ‘=’, to reset
     to default sort (which is on the entry key).
   • The user option ‘ebib-index-display-fields’ is replaced with
     ‘ebib-index-columns’, which has a different format: each element in
     ‘ebib-index-columns’ describes a column in the tabulated view and
     consists of a list containing the field name, the column’s width
     and a boolean indicating whether sorting on this column is
     possible.

1.10 Version 2.8, 26 October 2016
=================================

   • Changed key bindings: ‘j’ and ‘k’ no longer move up/down in the
     index, entry and strings buffers; use ‘p’ and ‘n’ instead.
     Furthermore, ‘i’ now executes ‘ebib-push-bibtex-key’ (used to be
     ‘p’), and ‘I’ (capital i) executes ‘ebib-browse-doi’ (used to be
     ‘i’).
   • In the index buffer, ‘ebib-search-next’ (which used to be bound to
     ‘n’) is no longer bound.  Instead, ‘ebib-search’ (still bound to
     ‘/’) activates a transient map which binds the keys ‘/’ and ‘RET’
     to ‘ebib-search-next’.  Any other key disables the transient keymap
     and is executed normally.
   • In the index buffer, ‘C-u /’ repeats the previous search.  (This
     fixes a small bug that has so far gone unnoticed: moving to the top
     of the databas and calling ‘ebib-search-next’, as previously
     suggested in the manual to get around the fact that
     ‘ebib-search-next’ does not wrap, would not search the first
     entry.)
   • In the entry buffer, ‘x’ is replaced by ‘k’
     (‘ebib-kill-field-contents’).
   • New functions: ‘ebib-kill-entry’ and ‘ebib-yank-entry’ for killing
     and yanking BibTeX entries.  ‘ebib-kill-entry’ deletes the current
     entry from the database and puts it in the kill ring.
     ‘ebib-yank-entry’ adds an entry from the kill ring to the current
     database.

1.11 Version 2.7, 22 September 2016
===================================

   • Reading list management: add and remove BibTeX entries to an Org
     reading list.
   • Remove options ‘ebib-notes-identifier-function’ and
     ‘ebib-notes-title-function’.
   • Add option ‘ebib-notes-template-specifiers’: allow customisation of
     the format specs used in ‘ebib-notes-template’.  (This option
     replaces ‘ebib-notes-identifier-function’ and
     ‘ebib-notes-title-function’).

1.12 Version 2.6.3, 31 August 2016
==================================

   • Allow storing notes in a single file rather than using one file per
     note.
   • Correct handling of DOIs.
   • Add option ‘ebib-truncate-file-names’: if set (the default), file
     names added to the ‘file’ field are truncated relative to
     ‘ebib-file-search-dirs’.
   • Add option ‘ebib-file-name-mod-function’: modify file paths before
     storing them in the ‘file’ field.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Package manager,  Next: Debian and Ubuntu,  Up: Installation

2.1 Package manager
===================

The easiest way to install Ebib is to use Emacs’ package manager.  Ebib
is available as a package from the Melpa package archive
(http://melpa.org/).  If you add the Melpa archive to your
‘package-archive’ list, you can install Ebib from the package manager.
This will also install the Info file so you can access the Ebib manual
within Emacs.

2.2 Debian and Ubuntu
=====================

Users of Debian 9 or later and Ubuntu 16.10 or later can also use their
distro’s package manager: ‘apt-get install elpa-ebib’.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Next: Starting Ebib,  Prev: Debian and Ubuntu,  Up: Installation

2.3 Manual installation
=======================

It’s also possible to install Ebib manually by downloading the source,
compiling it and telling Emacs where to find it.  If you prefer this
method, then you probably know what you’re doing so detailed
instructions are omitted here.  Just be sure to also install Ebib’s
dependencies, the dash (https://github.com/magnars/dash.el) and parsebib
(https://github.com/joostkremers/parsebib) libraries.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Starting Ebib,  Next: Upgrading from Ebib 1x,  Prev: Manual installation,  Up: Installation

2.4 Starting Ebib
=================

Once Ebib has been installed and is loaded, you can start it with ‘M-x
ebib’.  This command is also used to return to Ebib when you have put
the program in the background.  You can bind this command to a key
sequence by putting something like the following in Emacs’ init file:

(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'ebib)

   You can of course choose any key combination you like.  (In Emacs,
key combinations of ‘C-c’ ‘<letter>’ are reserved for the user, which
means that no package may set them.)

   You can also call Ebib from an Eshell command line.  This in itself
is entirely unspectacular (in Eshell, you can invoke any Emacs
function), but the nice thing is that you can then provide a filename to
load.  So, provided a file ‘references.bib’ exists in ‘~/Work/Papers/’,
the following command:

~/Work/Papers $ ebib references.bib

   starts Ebib and loads the file ‘references.bib’.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Upgrading from Ebib 1x,  Prev: Starting Ebib,  Up: Installation

2.5 Upgrading from Ebib 1.x
===========================

If you upgrade from Ebib 1.x to the current version 2, there are a few
things you need to be aware of.  First, Ebib 2 does not support Emacs
versions below 24.3.  If you’re on an older version of Emacs, either
upgrade Emacs, or do not upgrade Ebib.  Ebib 1.x will continue to be
available in the ‘pasture’ branch on Github or as a package on the
Github releases page, so if for some reason you do not want to upgrade,
you can continue to use this branch.  Ebib 1.x will continue to be
supported with bug fixes and possibly the occasional (small) feature
addition, though no major changes will take place.

   If you do upgrade, it is important to note that a few customisation
options have changed.  If you never made any customisations to Ebib, the
upgrade should not pose any problems.  If you have, however, read on.

   The most important change is that the variable ‘ebib-entry-types’
(option “Entry Types”) has been removed.  Ebib now uses the entry type
definitions of the built-in ‘bibtex-mode’, which means that if you wish
to customise the entry types, you should customise
‘bibtex-BibTeX-entry-alist’ or ‘bibtex-biblatex-entry-alist’.

   Secondly, a few user options have been renamed because their types
have changed.  (Mainly from ‘symbol’ to ‘string’).  The name change
means that existing customisations are lost, but it also prevents Ebib
from throwing cryptic errors and refusing to run.  If you customised any
of the following options, you should redo them after upgrading Ebib (and
preferably remove the old ones from your init file):

   • ‘ebib-default-entry’: renamed to ‘ebib-default-entry-type’.
   • ‘ebib-additional-fields’: renamed to ‘ebib-extra-fields’.
   • ‘ebib-standard-url-field’: renamed to ‘ebib-url-field’.
   • ‘ebib-standard-file-field’: renamed to ‘ebib-file-field’.
   • ‘ebib-standard-doi-field’: renamed to ‘ebib-doi-field’.
   • ‘ebib-biblatex-inheritance’: renamed to
     ‘ebib-biblatex-inheritances’ (note the ‘s’).

   Note that even if you customised ‘ebib-biblatex-inheritance’, there
is most likely no need to customise its replacement
‘ebib-biblatex-inheritances’, because the latter is set up with the
default inheritance rules that Biblatex defines.

   Another thing to note is that four user options have a new default
value.  First, the default location of the rc file has moved to
‘~/.emacs.d/ebibrc’, in line with the recommendation to keep all
Emacs-related files in ‘~/.emacs.d’.  If you kept an ‘.ebibrc’ file in
your home directory, move it to ‘~/.emacs.d’.  Second, a
‘\documentclass’ definition has been added to the user options “Latex
Preamble” (‘ebib-latex-preamble’) and “Print Preamble”
(‘ebib-print-preamble’).  If you customised one of these, you should add
a document class specification, otherwise the LaTeX file won’t compile.
Third, the option ‘ebib-save-xrefs-first’ now defaults to ‘t’.

   Lastly, if you use Biblatex, make sure to read the section on using
Ebib with Biblatex files.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Getting Started,  Next: Editing the Database,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Getting Started
*****************

A BibTeX database is somewhat of a free-form database.  A BibTeX entry
consists of a set of field-value pairs.  Furthermore, each entry is
known by a unique key.  The way that Ebib navigates this database is by
having two windows, one that contains a list of all the entry keys in
the database, and one that contains the fields and values of the
currently highlighted entry.

   When Ebib is started, the current windows in Emacs are hidden and the
Emacs frame is divided into two windows.  The top one contains a buffer
that is called the _index buffer_, while the lower window contains the
_entry buffer_.  When a database is loaded, the index buffer holds a
list of all the keys in the database plus some additional information
for each entry: the author or editor, its year of publication, and the
title.  You can move through the entries with the cursor keys.  In the
entry buffer, the fields of the currently highlighted entry are shown,
with their values.

   This manual first describes Ebib’s basic functionality, so that you
can get started with it.  At times, reference will be made to later
sections, where more specific functions are described.

   Ebib has a menu through which most functions can be accessed.
(Especially some of the lesser used functions can only be accessed
through the menu, unless you assign key shortcuts to them, of course.)

   You can start Ebib with the command ‘M-x ebib’.  Entering this
command hides all the windows in the current Emacs frame and replaces
them with two windows: the top one contains the index buffer, the bottom
one, taking up the larger part of the screen, contains the entry buffer.
The index buffer is named ‘none’, to indicate that no database has been
loaded.  If you open a database, or start a new one, the index buffer
will carry its name.

   You can quit Ebib by typing ‘q’.  You will be asked for confirmation,
and you will receive a warning if you happen to have an unsaved
database.  You can also leave Ebib with the command ‘z’.  However,
unlike ‘q’, which completely quits Ebib, ‘z’ only lowers it, so that it
remains active in the background.  The ‘.bib’ files that you have opened
remain loaded, and you can return to them by typing ‘M-x ebib’ again.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Opening a bib File,  Next: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

3.1 Opening a ‘.bib’ File
=========================

Loading a ‘.bib’ file into Ebib is done with the command ‘o’.  Ebib
reads the file that you specify, and reports how many entries it found,
how many ‘@string’ definitions it found, and whether a ‘@preamble’ was
found.  Note that when Ebib reads a ‘.bib’ file, it only reads entry
types (e.g.  ‘book, article, phdthesis’ etc.)  that it knows about.
Therefore, you should make sure that all the entry types and fields that
your databases use are defined.  Ebib uses the entry type definitions of
‘bibtex.el’, which is fairly complete, but if you use non-standard entry
types, you may need to customise ‘bibtex-bibtex-entry-alist’ or
‘bibtex-biblatex-entry-alist’, depending on which of the two you use.

   Every time Ebib reads a ‘.bib’ file, it produces a few log messages.
These are written into a special buffer ‘*Ebib-log*’.  If Ebib
encounters entry types in the ‘.bib’ file that it doesn’t know, a
warning will be logged.  If Ebib finds something that it cannot parse,
it will log an error.  If warnings and/or errors occurred during
loading, Ebib will issue a message when it finishes loading the ‘.bib’
and direct you to the log buffer.

   If Ebib finds entry types in a ‘.bib’ file that are not defined,
those entries will still be loaded, but their entry type is displayed
using Emacs’ ‘error’ face.  The most likely case in which this will
happen is when you load a Biblatex file without letting Ebib know the
file is Biblatex-specific.  By default, Ebib assumes that a ‘.bib’ file
it loads is a BibTeX file.  If you intend to use Biblatex files, make
sure to read the section on Biblatex (*note Using Biblatex:
#using-biblatex.).


File: ebib.info,  Node: Preloading bib Files,  Next: Navigating a bib File,  Prev: Opening a bib File,  Up: Getting Started

3.2 Preloading ‘.bib’ Files
===========================

Chances are that you will be doing most of your work with one or a few
‘.bib’ files, and you may find yourself opening the same file or files
every time you start Ebib.  If so, you can tell Ebib to always load
specific ‘.bib’ files on startup.  To do this, specify the files in
Ebib’s customisation buffer, under the option “Preload Bib Files”
(‘ebib-preload-bib-files’).

   By default, ‘.bib’ files are searched for in your home directory.
Since this is most likely not where you keep the files, you need to
specify either the file’s full path or a relative path starting from
your home directory.  Alternatively, you can customise the option “Bib
Search Dirs” (‘ebib-bib-search-dirs’) to specify one or more directories
in which Ebib should search the ‘.bib’ files.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Navigating a bib File,  Next: Starting a New bib File,  Prev: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

3.3 Navigating a ‘.bib’ File
============================

Once you’ve opened a ‘.bib’ file, all the entries in the file are shown
in alphabetical order (sorted by entry key, though this is customisable)
in the index buffer in the top Ebib window.  The first entry is
highlighted, meaning it is the current entry.  The fields it holds and
their values are shown in the entry buffer in the bottom Ebib window.
The first field is the type field, which tells you what kind of entry
you’re dealing with (i.e.  ‘book’, ‘article’, etc.).

   Below the type field, Ebib displays (up to) four sets of fields.  The
first set are the so-called required fields, the fields that Bib(La)TeX
requires to be filled.  The second group are the optional fields, which
do not have to be filled but which Bib(La)TeX will normally add to the
bibliography if they do have a value.  The third group is the so-called
extra fields.  These fields are usually ignored by Bib(La)TeX (note that
Bib(La)TeX normally ignores _all_ fields it does not know), although
there are bibliography styles that treat some of these fields as
optional rather than as extra.  Extra fields are defined in the user
option “Extra Fields” (‘ebib-extra-fields’).  Lastly, the fourth set of
fields shown in the entry buffer are fields that exist in the entry but
are not defined as part of the entry type nor as extra fields.

   The first two groups of fields are different for each entry type,
while the third group is common to all entry types.  You can use the
extra fields, for example, to add personal comments to the works in your
database.  Ebib by default defines the following extra fields:
‘crossref’, ‘url’ (BibTeX only), ‘annote’ (‘annotation’ for Biblatex),
‘abstract’, ‘keywords’, ‘file’, ‘timestamp’, and ‘doi’ (BibTeX only).
‘url’ and ‘doi’ are defined only for BibTeX, since Biblatex defines them
as optional fields for most entry types.  If these are not sufficient
for you, you can customise the option “Extra Fields”.

   To move around in the index buffer, you can use the ‘up’ and ‘down’
cursor keys, ‘p’ and ‘n’ and also the versions with the control key
‘C-p’ and ‘C-n’.  Furthermore, ‘Space’ and ‘PgDn’ move a screenful of
entries down, while ‘b’ and ‘PgUp’ move in the other direction.  Lastly,
‘g’ and ‘Home’ move to the first entry, while ‘G’ and ‘End’ move to the
last one.

   Ebib is not restricted to opening just one ‘.bib’ file at a time.
You can open more files by just typing ‘o’ again and entering the
filename.  Ebib numbers the databases: the number of each database is
shown in the mode line of the index buffer, directly before the database
name.  The keys 1–9 provide a quick way of jumping from one database to
another.  Note that the numbering is dynamic: if you have three
databases opened and then close the second, database 3 becomes database
2.

   With the ‘left’ and ‘right’ cursor keys, you can move to the previous
or next database.  These keys wrap, so if you hit the ‘left’ cursor key
while the first database is active, you move to the last database.  If
you are done with a database and want to close it, type ‘c’.  This
closes the current database.  It does not leave Ebib, and all other
databases you have open will remain so.

3.4 Starting a New ‘.bib’ File
==============================

If you want to start a new ‘.bib’ file from scratch, you cannot just go
and enter entries.  You first have to give the database a name.  So, to
start a new database, type ‘o’ first, and give the new file a name.
Once you have done this, you can start adding entries to the database.

4 Editing the Database
**********************

Of course, being able to open and view ‘.bib’ files is only half the
fun.  One needs to be able to edit the files as well.  Ebib’s essential
editing facilities are discussed here.

* Adding and Deleting Entries::
* Editing Fields Values::
* Editing Multiline Values::
* Undefined Fields::
* Hidden Fields::
* Timestamps::
* Copy Cut Kill Paste Yank and Delete::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Next: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

4.1 Adding and Deleting Entries
===============================

To add an entry to a database, you type ‘a’.  When you do this, Ebib
first asks you for an entry key, as every entry must be identified by a
unique key.  Just type a name for the new entry (say ‘Jones1998’).
Since the entry key must be unique, Ebib will complain if you enter a
key that already exists.

   You can also let Ebib automatically generate entry keys: if you set
the customisation option “Autogenerate Keys” (‘ebib-autogenerate-keys’),
Ebib does not ask you for a key when you add a new entry.  Instead, it
creates a temporary key (of the form ‘<new-entry00>’).  When you have
finished entering the field values for the new entry, Ebib automatically
replaces the temporary key with a key that is based on the contents of
the ‘author’ (or ‘editor’), ‘year’ and ‘title’ fields.  (It uses the
function ‘bibtex-generate-autokey’ for this; see that function’s
documentation string for customisation options.)

   Note that if you should later decide that you want to change the key
of an entry, you can do so with the command ‘E’.  So if you have an
entry with the key ‘Jones1998’ and you want to add another entry by
Jones from 1998, you can call the new one ‘Jones1998b’ and rename the
existing one to ‘Jones1998a’.  Similarly, it is possible to let Ebib
recreate an autogenerated key by pressing ‘!’.

   Deleting an entry is done in two ways.  The key ‘d’ deletes an entry
from the database.  This command asks for confirmation, because once an
entry has been deleted, it cannot be retrieved again.  Alternatively,
you can use ‘k’, which kills the current entry, i.e., the entry is
deleted from the database and added to the kill ring.

   The key ‘y’ lets you yank an entry from the kill ring into the
current database.  If the first element in the kill ring is not a
properly formatted BibTeX entry, the kill ring is simply rotated.  This
means that you can press ‘y’ again to (try and) add the next element in
the kill ring to the database.

   In order for ‘y’ to add a BibTeX entry to the database, the kill ring
item to be yanked must be a string that constitutes a properly formatted
BibTeX entry.  Killing an entry from a database will result in such a
string (so you can easily move entries from one database to another by
killing and then yanking them), but killing a BibTeX entry from another
buffer or copying one from an outside source (e.g., a website) is also
possible.  Furthermore, yanking also works with ‘@Preamble’, ‘@String’
and ‘@Comment’ definitions.

4.2 Editing Fields Values
=========================

Editing the field values for an entry is done in the lower of the two
Ebib buffers, the so-called entry buffer.  You can move focus to the
entry buffer and start editing field values by typing the command ‘e’ in
the index buffer.

   You can move between fields with the same keys that you use to move
between entries in the index buffer: the cursor keys ‘up’ and ‘down’,
‘p’ and ‘n’ or ‘C-p’ and ‘C-n’.  ‘Space’ and ‘PgDn’ move to the next set
of fields, while ‘PgUp’ and ‘b’ move to the previous set of fields.  ‘g’
and ‘G’, and ‘Home’ and ‘End’ also work as expected.

   Editing a field value can be done with ‘e’.  (In fact, in the entry
buffer, ‘RET’ is equivalent to ‘e’.)  For most fields, Ebib simply asks
you for a string value in the minibuffer.  (Here, ‘RET’ confirms the
edit, while ‘C-g’ cancels it.)  Although BibTeX requires that field
values be surrounded by braces {} (or double quotes "", but Ebib does
not use those, even though it can of course handle them when they are
used in an existing ‘.bib’ file) you do not need to type these.  Ebib
adds them when it saves the ‘.bib’ file.

   Some fields, however, are handled in a special way.  The first of
these is the ‘type’ field: if you edit this field, you must enter one of
the predefined entry types.  Ebib won’t allow you to enter anything
else.  You can use TAB completion in this case.  Similarly, if you edit
the ‘crossref’ field, Ebib requires that you fill in a key from the
database.  Here, too, you can use TAB completion.  The fields ‘keywords’
and ‘file’ are also treated differently, see *note Managing keywords:
#managing-keywords. and *note Viewing Files: #viewing-files,
respectively.

   Note that if you’re adding a new entry, Ebib automatically puts you
in the entry buffer after you’ve typed the entry key: you don’t have to
type ‘e’ to move to the entry buffer.  When creating a new entry, you
should set the ‘type’ field first, because the ‘type’ field determines
which other fields are available for an entry.  After editing a field,
Ebib puts you on the next field.  This is convenient if you’re creating
a new entry and need to fill out several fields in a row.

   If you’re done editing the fields of the entry, type ‘q’ to move
focus back to the index buffer.  (Note: keys may have different
functions in the index buffer and the entry buffer.  ‘q’ is a typical
example: in the entry buffer, it quits editing the entry and moves focus
back to the index buffer.  In the index buffer, however, ‘q’ quits
Ebib.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Multiline Values,  Next: Undefined Fields,  Prev: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

4.3 Editing Multiline Values
============================

Apart from the ‘type’, ‘keywords’, ‘file’ and ‘crossref’ fields, there
is another field that Ebib handles in a special way when you edit its
value.  This is the ‘annote’ field (‘annotation’ in Biblatex).  Most
field values normally consist of a single line of text.  However,
because the ‘annote’ field is meant for creating annotated
bibliographies, it would not be very useful if you could only write one
line of text in this field.  Therefore, when you edit the ‘annote’
field, Ebib puts you in a so-called _multiline edit buffer_.  This is
essentially a text mode buffer that allows you to enter as much text as
you like.  To store the text and leave the multiline edit buffer, type
‘C-c | q’.

   If you want to leave the multiline edit buffer without saving the
text you have just typed, type ‘C-c | c’.  This command cancels the edit
and leaves the multiline edit buffer.  The text that is stored in the
field you were editing is not altered.

   Multiline values are not restricted to the ‘annote’ field.  Any field
(except the ‘type’ and ‘crossref’ fields) can in fact hold a multiline
value.  To give a field a multiline value, use ‘m’ instead of ‘e’.  You
will again be put in a multiline edit buffer, where you can edit the
value.  Note that you can use ‘m’ even if a field already has a single
line value.  Ebib will just make that the first line in the multiline
edit buffer.

   When a field has a multiline value, only the first line is shown in
the entry buffer, for space reasons.  To indicate that the value is
multiline, a plus sign ‘+’ is placed in front of the value.  If you want
to see the whole contents of a multiline field, you can use ‘v’: this
will display the contents of the current field in a ‘*Help*’ buffer.
This buffer can be dismissed again with ‘q’.  This is quicker than
entering the multiline edit buffer just to read the contents of a field
and it has the advantage that the other fields stay visible.

   By the way, the ‘e’ key is smart about the way an entry must be
edited.  If you press ‘e’ on a field that already has a multiline value,
regardless of the fact whether it is the ‘annote’ field or not, Ebib
puts you in a multiline edit buffer.  Therefore, you need ‘m’ only if
you want to give a field a multiline value when it doesn’t have one yet.

   For more details on working with multiline edit buffers, see *note
Multiline Edit Buffers: #multiline-edit-buffers.

4.4 Undefined Fields
====================

Bib(la)TeX ignores fields that it does not know, which is a property
that can be exploited to add any kind of information to an entry.  Ebib
accommodates this by allowing fields with any name, not just the ones
that are predefined.  Such undefined fields are displayed last in the
entry buffer, following the extra fields.

   It is even possible to add such fields to an entry by pressing ‘a’ in
the entry buffer.  This asks for a field name and then a value.  If you
make heavy use of this option, it may be better to define the relevant
fields through the user option “Extra Fields”, but undefined fields may
be useful when reading or importing BibTeX entries from a different
source that contain non-standard fields.

   Note that if you delete the contents of an undefined field, the field
itself is also deleted.  (In fact, the field remains in the database
until you close the database, but it will not be saved, so the next time
you load the ‘.bib’ file, the field is gone.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Hidden Fields,  Next: Timestamps,  Prev: Undefined Fields,  Up: Editing the Database

4.5 Hidden Fields
=================

Biblatex defines a large number of fields, many of which are optional
for most entry types.  Displaying all these fields in the entry buffer
would not be very practical, because you are most likely interested in
only a few of them.  For this reason, Ebib defines a (fairly large)
number of fields as ‘hidden’, meaning that they are not shown in the
entry buffer.  You can make these fields visible with the key ‘H’ in the
index buffer.  Which fields are treated as hidden is controlled by the
option “Hidden Fields” (‘ebib-hidden-fields’), which can be customised.

   Most of the fields defined as hidden are Biblatex-specific, because
BibTeX recognises a much smaller number of fields and there isn’t much
of a need to hide the lesser used ones.  However, the functionality is
available: if you wish to use it, just add the relevant fields to the
option “Hidden Fields”.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Copy Cut Kill Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Hidden Fields,  Up: Editing the Database

4.6 Timestamps
==============

Ebib provides the possibility to add a timestamp to every new entry,
recording the time it was added to the database.  The timestamp is
recorded in the (extra) field ‘timestamp’, which is hidden by default.

   You can tell Ebib to create timestamps by setting the option “Use
Timestamp” (‘ebib-use-timestamp’) in Ebib’s customisation buffer.  With
this option set, a timestamp is included in entries added to the
database with ‘a’.  Ebib will also add a timestamp to entries imported
from a buffer or merged from a file, and to entries exported to another
database or to a file.  When importing or exporting entries, existing
timestamps will be overwritten.  The logic behind this is that the
timestamp records the date and time when the entry was added to the
database, not when it was first created.

   Note that if this option is unset, the timestamp of an entry is
retained when it’s imported or exported.  Therefore, if you record
timestamps and want to im-/export entries without changing their
timestamps, temporarily unset this option, which can be done in the menu
under “Options”.

   Ebib uses the function ‘format-time-string’ to create the timestamp.
The format string that Ebib uses can be customised.  The default string
is ‘"%a %b’ ‘%e %T %Y"’, which produces a timestamp of the form ‘"Mon
Mar 12 01:03:26 2007"’.  This string is not directly suitable for
sorting, so if you want to be able to sort on timestamps, you’ll need to
customise the format string.  See the documentation for
‘format-time-string’ on the options that are available.  (Alternatively,
the default time stamp format can be converted into a sortable time
format using ‘date-to-time’, but currently Ebib is not able to do this
automatically.)

   Adding timestamps in a format that ‘date-to-time’ can parse makes it
possible to list the most recent additions to the database.  Ebib
provides a function to do this: ‘ebib-list-recent’, which asks for a
number of days and lists the entries that were added since then.

4.7 Copy, Cut (Kill), Paste (Yank), and Delete
==============================================

A few more commands are available when you’re in the entry buffer
editing field values.  The commands ‘c’, ‘k’ and ‘y’ implement copy,
kill and yank: ‘c’ copies the contents of the current field to the kill
ring, ‘k’ kills the contents of the current field to the kill ring, and
‘y’ yanks (pastes) the most recently killed text in the kill ring.  You
can type ‘y’ repeatedly to get the same effect you get in Emacs when you
type ‘M-y’ after an initial ‘C-y’.

   Lastly, there is the command ‘d’, which deletes the contents of the
current field without storing the text in the kill ring.  (It asks for
confirmation, though, just to make sure.)

   Note that ‘y’ only works when the current field does not have a value
yet.  This is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting a field
value.  If you do want to yank text into a field that already has a
value, simply hit ‘d’ first to delete the text.

5 Saving a Database
*******************

When you have undertaken any kind of editing action on a database, it is
marked as modified, which is indicated in the mode line for the index
buffer.  A modified database can be saved by typing ‘s’.  This saves the
database to the file it was loaded from without asking for confirmation.
(It is similar to ‘C-x C-s’ in Emacs.)  If you’re saving a file for the
first time after loading it, Ebib creates a backup file.  (Ebib honours
‘backup-directory-alist’ when saving backups.  Note that you can also
disable backups altogether with the option “Create Backups”,
‘ebib-create-backups’.)

   If you want to force-save a database that has not been modified, you
can use a prefix argument: ‘C-u s’.  In either case, however, Ebib
checks whether the underlying file was modified and warns you if it was.
(Ebib does this by storing the ‘.bib’ file’s modification time when
reading the file and comparing this time with the modification time when
requested to save the file.)  If you also want to forego this check, use
a double prefix argument: ‘C-u C-u s’.  This saves the file
unconditionally.

   If you have multiple databases open, have made changes in more than
one of them, and want to save all of them without going through each
yourself, you can save all databases at once through the menu.  You can
also save the database to another name, similar to ‘C-x C-w’ in Emacs:
the new ‘.bib’ file becomes associated with the database.  The command
for this is ‘w’.  This command can also be prefixed with ‘C-u’ (or in
fact any other prefix argument) in order to overwrite any existing file
without asking for confirmation.

6 Using Biblatex
****************

Compared to BibTeX, Biblatex has a greatly expanded number of fields, a
somewhat different set of entry types and a much more complex system of
field value inheritances.  Ebib can handle both kinds of files, provided
it is set up for the right “dialect”.
* Menu:

* Setting the BibTeX Dialect::
* Alias Types and Fields::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Setting the BibTeX Dialect,  Next: Alias Types and Fields,  Up: Using Biblatex

6.1 Setting the BibTeX Dialect
==============================

Biblatex files use the same ‘.bib’ suffix that BibTeX files use.
Whether Ebib interprets a file as a BibTeX or a Biblatex file is
determined by the user option “Bibtex Dialect” (‘ebib-bibtex-dialect’).
Possible values for this option are ‘BibTeX’ and ‘biblatex’, the default
being ‘BibTeX’.  (These values are taken from the variable
‘bibtex-dialect-list’.)

   The dialect specified determines which entry types Ebib recognises
and which fields it expects.  Reading a file with the wrong dialect
setting will most likely result in a series of “Illegal entry type”
errors.  Note, however, that these entries will still be loaded and
displayed, but they will be highlighted with Emacs’ ‘error’ face.
Fields that are not defined for the current dialect are displayed as
undefined fields (i.e., below all other fields in the entry buffer).

   The option “Bibtex Dialect” sets the default dialect, which is the
dialect that Ebib gives to newly created ‘.bib’ files and which it
assumes for files that are not otherwise specified.  If you wish to work
with a file that is in a different dialect than what you set as the
default, you can set the dialect for this particular file.  To do this,
load the file and then set the dialect through the menu option «Ebib |
BibTeX Dialect» or with the command ‘M-x ebib-set-dialect’.  You only
need to do this once for a file, because the setting is saved in the
‘.bib’ file in the local variable block.  (If no local variable block
exists, one is created.)  The setting is actually saved as a file-local
value for the variable ‘bibtex-dialect’, which means that if you should
open the file directly in ‘bibtex-mode’, Emacs will apply the dialect
setting as well.

   The mode line of the index buffer shows the dialect that Ebib assumes
for the current database.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that
the dialect is set in the ‘.bib’ file: if the file does not have a
dialect setting, the mode line shows the default setting.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Alias Types and Fields,  Prev: Setting the BibTeX Dialect,  Up: Using Biblatex

6.2 Alias Types and Fields
==========================

The set of entry types defined by Biblatex differs from the set used by
BibTeX. Mostly, Biblatex adds new entry types, but there are a few
BibTeX entry types that have been dropped.  For legacy reasons, Biblatex
still recognises these entry types, but it treats them as aliases for
some of its own types.  The relevant entry types are ‘@conference’
(treated as an alias for ‘@inproceedings’), ‘@electronic’ (alias for
‘@online’), ‘@mastersthesis’ (alias for ‘@thesis’ with the ‘type’ field
set to ‘Master’s thesis’), ‘@phdthesis’ (alias for ‘@thesis’ with the
‘type’ field set to ‘PhD thesis’), ‘@techreport’ (alias for ‘@report’
with the ‘type’ field set to ‘technical report’) and ‘@www’ (alias for
‘@online’).  If an entry has such an alias as entry type, Ebib displays
the entry type that Biblatex treats it as in the entry buffer.  (For
example, the entry type alias ‘phdthesis’ is shown as ‘phdthesis [==>
Thesis]’.)

   Similarly, a number of fields are deprecated but still accepted as
aliases.  These are ‘address’ (alias for ‘location’), ‘annote’ (alias
for ‘annotation’), ‘archiveprefix’ (for ‘eprinttype’), ‘journal’ (for
‘journaltitle’), ‘key’ (for ‘sortkey’), ‘pdf’ (for ‘file’),
‘primaryclass’ (for ‘eprintclass’), and ‘school’ (for ‘institution’).
These aliases are also indicated in the entry buffer, albeit in a
slightly different way.  For example, if an entry has a ‘journal’ field,
its value is shown as the value of the ‘journaltitle’ field; a tag ‘[<==
journal]’ is placed after the field value, indicating that the value is
actually contained in the journal field.  The ‘journal’ field itself is
shown as an undefined field (i.e., after all other fields).  That is, in
such cases, the value is shown twice: once as the ‘journaltitle’ field
(among the obligatory fields), and once as the ‘journal’ field.  This is
done so that you can easily copy the value of the ‘journal’ field to the
‘journaltitle’ field, if you wish to bring your entries into line with
Biblatex’s conventions.

7 The Entries List
******************

By default, the index buffer displays the list of entries in the
database in a table format using the entry key, and the author, year and
title fields of each entry.  The entries are sorted in ascending order
on the first column, which by default is the entry key.  You can sort
the entries on one of the other columns using the keys ‘<’ and ‘>’.  The
former performs an ascending sort (smallest to largest, hence the
smaller-than sign), the latter a descending sort.  They both ask you for
the column to sort on.  Restoring the default sort can be done with ‘=’.

   The fields that are displayed in the index buffer can be customised
with the user option ‘ebib-index-columns’.  Each element in this option
describes a column and consists of the field to display (which is also
the column label), the width of the column and a flag indicating whether
the column can be sorted.  You can add or remove fields, or reorder the
existing ones.

   You can use any BibTeX / BibLaTeX field to define a column in the
index buffer.  In addition, there are two column labels with a special
meaning: ‘"Entry Key"’, which displays the entry key, and
‘"Author/Editor"’, which displays the contents of the author field if it
is not empty, and the contents of the editor field otherwise.

   The first column defined in ‘ebib-index-colums’ is the column on
which the entries are sorted by default, i.e., when the database is
first opened and when you press ‘=’.  You can change the default sort
field and the default sort direction (which is ascending, i.e., A-Z and
0-9) by customising the option ‘ebib-index-default-sort’.

8 Searching
***********

* Menu:

* Simple Searches::
* Filters::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Searches,  Next: Filters,  Up: Searching

8.1 Simple Searches
===================

Ebib provides several search methods.  First of all, in the index
buffer, the normal Emacs incremental searches, ‘C-s’ and ‘C-r’, can be
used to search entry keys.  Once you’ve found the key you’re searching,
you must hit ‘RET’ to quit the search and again ‘RET’ to make the entry
you found active: Ebib does not update the entry buffer during
incremental search.  If you make frequent use of this option, you may
want to make the cursor visible in the Ebib buffers.  Unset the
customisation option “Hide Cursor” (‘ebib-hide-cursor’) to do so.

   The contents of the entries can be searched with ‘/’.  This command
(‘ebib-search’) searches for a string (more precisely, a regular
expression) starting from the current entry (i.e., _not_ from the first
entry) and will display the entry with the first occurrence of the
search string that it finds.  All the occurrences of the search string
in that entry are highlighted.

   Ebib searches all the fields of each entry.  It is not possible with
‘/’ to specify the fields to search.  Note that if the search term is
found in a field with a multiline value, Ebib will highlight the ‘+’
sign that is displayed in front of the field value.  When the search
term is found, Ebib gives a message saying so, similarly if the search
term was not found.

   A search term may of course appear more than once in the database.
To search for the next occurrence, type ‘/’ again (or, alternatively
type ‘RET’).  This continues searching for the search term in the rest
of the database.  Again, the first entry found to contain the search
string is displayed.  Note that the search does not wrap: if the end of
the database is reached, Ebib stops searching and informs you that no
further occurrence of the search string was found.  If you want to
continue searching from the top, type ‘g’ and then continue the search
with ‘/’ or ‘RET’.

   Note that once you’ve started a search with ‘/’, Ebib activates a
transient key map called ‘ebib-search-map’.  It is this map that holds
the bindings of ‘/’ and ‘RET’ to continue searching after the current
entry and of the key ‘g’ to jump to the top of the database.  You can,
of course, bind or rebind keys in this map.

   Exiting a search (i.e., getting rid of the transient key map) is done
by pressing any key other than ‘/’, ‘RET’ or ‘g’.  The search is ended
and the command associated with this key is executed normally.  If you
want to repeat a previous search, you can pass a prefix argument to ‘/’.
So typing ‘C-u /’ (or any other prefix argument) starts searching for
the previous search string again.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Filters,  Prev: Simple Searches,  Up: Searching

8.2 Filters
===========

Ebib also has a much more sophisticated search mechanism that makes use
of _filters_.  A filter is basically a search expression that selects
entries from the current database.  When you apply a filter to a
database, only the entries that match are shown.  With filters, you can,
for example, select all entries from a database that contain the string
“Jones” in their ‘author’ field.  A filter can be as complex as you
want: you can select all entries that do _not_ contain “Jones” in the
‘author’ field, or all entries that contain “Jones” in either the
‘author’ or the ‘editor’ field, or all entries that contain “Jones” in
the ‘author’ field, and “symbiotic hibernation” in the ‘keyword’ field,
etc.  Basically, the filter can consist of an arbitary number of search
criteria combined with the logical operators ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Selection,  Next: Complex Filters,  Up: Filters

8.2.1 Simple Selection
----------------------

Creating a filter is simple: press ‘&’, and Ebib will ask you for a
field to select on, and for a regular expression to select with.  So if
you want to select all entries that contain “Jones” in the ‘author’
field, you press ‘&’ and type ‘author’ as the field and ‘Jones’ as the
regexp to filter on.  Ebib then runs this filter on the database, and
only shows those entries that match the filter.  To indicate that a
filter is active, the active filter is displayed in the mode line of
index buffer.  (The filter can be displayed in Lisp form, if you prefer:
customise “Filters Display As Lisp” to do so.)

   If you don’t want to filter on one specific field but rather want to
select all entries that match a certain regexp in any field, you can
type ‘any’ as the field to filter on.  So specifying ‘any’ as the field
and ‘Jones’ as the regexp will give you all entries that have a field
that contains “Jones” in them.

   Note that you can also select items based on their entry type.  In
order to do that, you need to specify ‘=type=’ as the field to search,
which is the field name in which Ebib stores the entry type internally.
(There is also a “normal” field called ‘type’, hence the equal signs.)
If you search the ‘=type=’ field, only exact matches are returned, so if
you search for ‘book’, only the entries that are of type ‘book’ are
returned, not those of type ‘inbook’.  You can use TAB completion in
this case, by the way.

   If you specify the ‘keywords’ field, the keywords associated with
your database are available for TAB completion as well.  Though you can
enter any search term, of course.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Complex Filters,  Next: Storing and Saving Filters,  Prev: Simple Selection,  Up: Filters

8.2.2 Complex Filters
---------------------

Once you have a filter on your database, you can refine or extend it.
For example, suppose you have a filter selecting all entries with
“Jones” in the ‘author’ field and want to add all entries that have
“Jones” in the editor field to your selection.  In this case you need to
do a logical ‘or’ operation: you want to select an entry if it contains
“Jones” in the ‘author’ field (which you already did) _or_ if it
contains “Jones” in the ‘editor’ field.

   A short sidenote: the first impulse in a case like this might be to
use ‘and’ instead of ‘or’: after all, you want to select all entries
that contain “Jones” in the ‘author’ field _and_ all entries that
contain “Jones” in the ‘editor’ field.  However, the filter that you
build up is used to test each entry _individually_ whether it meets the
selection criterion.  An entry meets the criterion if it contains
“Jones” in the ‘author’ field _or_ if it contains “Jones” in the
‘editor’ field.  Therefore, ‘or’ is the required operator in this case.
If you would use ‘and’, you would only get those entries that contain
“Jones” in both the ‘author’ _and_ ‘editor’ fields.

   To perform a logical ‘or’ operation, press the key ‘|’.  As before,
you will be asked which field you want to filter on, and which regexp
you want to filter with.  Ebib will then update the index buffer.

   It is also possible to perform a logical ‘and’ on the filter.  Use
this if you want to select those entries that contain “Jones” in the
‘author’ field and e.g.  “symbiotic hibernation” in the ‘keyword’ field.
A logical ‘and’ operation is done with the key ‘&’.  (Note: this is the
same key that is used to create the filter.  In fact, you can create a
filter with ‘|’ as well: when used in an unfiltered database, ‘&’ and
‘|’ are equivalent.  They are only different when a filter is already
active.)

   Both the ‘&’ and ‘|’ commands can be used with the negative prefix
argument ‘M--’ (or ‘C-u -’, which is identical).  In this case, the
search criterion is negated.  That is, the negative prefix argument
performs a logical ‘not’ operation on the search criterion.  For
example, if you want to select all entries from a database that do _not_
contain “Jones” in the ‘author’ field, you can do this by typing ‘M-- &’
and then filling out the relevant field and regexp.

   There is another way of performing a logical ‘not’ operation, which
is only available when a filter is active: by pressing the key ‘~’, you
invert the current filter.  That is, if you have a filtered database
with all the entries containing “Jones” in the ‘author’ or in the
‘editor’ field, and you press ‘~’, the selection is inverted, and now
contains all entries that do _not_ have “Jones” in the ‘author’ or
‘editor’ field.

   Although ‘~’ and the negative prefix argument to ‘&’ or ‘|’ both
perform logical ‘not’ operations, they are _not_ equivalent: ‘~’ negates
the entire filter built up so far, while the negative prefix argument
only negates the single selection criterion you enter with it.

   When a filter is active, the filter itself is displayed at the top of
the index buffer.  If the index window is too small to display the
entire filter (which can easily happen if Ebib is set to split the frame
vertically rather than horizontally), you can press ‘F v’ (uppercase
‘F’, small ‘v’), which will display the filter in the minibuffer.

   To cancel the filter and return to the normal view of the database,
press ‘F c’.  For convenience, this action is also available with ‘c’,
which normally closes a database.  If a filter is active, however, it
simply cancels the filter.  (If you find this behaviour confusing, you
can rebind the ‘c’ key to the function ‘ebib-close-database’.  See *note
Modifying Key Bindings: #modifying-key-bindings. for details.)

8.2.3 Storing and Saving Filters
--------------------------------

When you cancel a filter, it is automatically stored so that it can be
reapplied later.  To reapply a filter, type ‘F L’.  This will reapply
the last used filter regardless of which database you’re in.  That is,
you can use this to search more than one database without having to type
the filter over and over.

   However, Ebib only stores one filter this way.  If you want to store
more filters, you have to name them.  You can store the currently active
filter or the last used filter with ‘F s’.  Ebib will ask you for a name
for the filter in order to identify it later.  By default, filter names
are case-insensitive, but if you prefer to use case-sensitive filter
names, you can unset the option “Filters Ignore Case”.  When Ebib is
closed, all stored filters are saved to a file and they’re automatically
reloaded when you open Ebib again.  Stored filters are not associated
with a particular database: once a filter is stored, it is available to
all databases.

   You can apply a stored filter with ‘F a’.  This will ask for the name
of a filter and apply it to the current database.  You can extend the
filter in the normal way, though the changes will not be stored
automatically.  To store it, type ‘F s’ again.  You can store the
extended filter under the old name, in which case Ebib will ask you for
confirmation, or under a new name, which will store it as a new filter,
keeping the old one.

   The file that Ebib uses to store filters is
‘~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters’, although that can of course be customised
(see the option “Filters Default File”).  As mentioned, stored filters
are saved automatically when Ebib closes, but you can also save them
manually with ‘F S’.  Note that if there are no stored filters when Ebib
is closed (or when you press ‘F S’), the file is deleted.

   You can also save your filters to a different file with ‘F w’.  Such
a filter file can be reloaded later with ‘F l’.  If you load filters
from a file while you still have stored filters, you are asked if you
want to replace them completely or if you want to add the new filters to
the existing ones.  In the latter case, however, filters whose name
conflict with existing filters are not loaded.  (Ebib will log a message
about this when this happens.)

   To see what filters are currently stored, use ‘F V’.  If you want to
rename a filter, you can do so with ‘F R’.

   Note that cancelling a filter with ‘F c’ does not delete it from the
list of stored filters, it will remain available for later application.
If you want to delete a filter from the list of stored filters, use ‘F
d’.  You can also delete all stored filters with ‘F D’.  These deletion
commands do not ask for confirmation, but if you delete any filters by
accident, you can reload them from ‘~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters’ with ‘F l’.

8.2.4 Special Filters
---------------------

Filters are essentially Lisp expressions that consist of the functions
‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘not’, together with a special macro ‘contains’.
However, filters are not limited to these forms.  They can essentially
contain any Lisp expression.  It is not possible to create such special
filters interactively, but it is possible to write such filters and put
them in a filter file, or to write a function that creates a special
filter.

   A filter is a Lisp expression that should return either ‘t’ or ‘nil’,
indicating whether the entry being tested matches the filter or not.
The contents of the entry is available in a variable ‘entry’.  This
variable is given a value by the function that runs the filter, but it
is not passed as an argument.  Rather, it is a local dynamic variable,
which means that the file that defines the filter function should have
the variable ‘lexical-binding’ set to ‘nil’.

   The value of ‘entry’ is an alist of fields and their values.  These
include the fields ‘=key=’ and ‘=type=’ for the entry key and type:

(("author" . "{Noam Chomsky}")
 ("title" . "{Syntactic Structures}")
 ("publisher" . "{The Hague: Mouton}")
 ("year" . "{1957}")
 ("remark" . "{copy}")
 ("timestamp" . "{2007-12-30}")
 ("file" . "{c/Chomsky1957.pdf}")
 ("=type=" . "book")
 ("=key=" . "Chomsky1957"))

8.2.5 An Example: Listing Recent Additions
------------------------------------------

One special filter is included with Ebib.  It filters recent additions
to the database.  The command that creates the filter is
‘ebib-list-recent’:

(defun ebib-list-recent (days)
  "List entries created in the last DAYS days."
  (interactive "nNumber of days: ")
  ;; save the database's current filter, if there is one.
  (let ((filter (ebib-db-get-filter ebib--cur-db)))
    (when filter (setq ebib--filters-last-filter filter)))
  (let*
      ;; calculate the from-date in Emacs' time format
      ((date (time-subtract (current-time) (days-to-time days)))
       ;; create a Lisp expression that will function as the filter
       (filter `(ebib--newer-than (quote ,date))))
    ;; install it as the curretn database's filter
    (ebib-db-set-filter filter ebib--cur-db)
    ;; update the display, so that only filtered entries are visible
    (ebib--redisplay)))

   First, this function saves the current filter if there is one.  It
then creates a date in Emacs’ internal time format by subtracting the
number of days provided by the user from the current date and uses this
date to create a Lisp expression which is then installed as the filter
for the current database.  A call to ‘ebib--redisplay’ then updates the
display, taking the filter into account.

   The function ‘ebib--newer-than’ is defined as follows:

(defun ebib--newer-than (date)
  "Function for use in filters.
Return t if the entry being tested is newer than DATE.  DATE must
be a list of the format returned by `current-time' and is
compared to the timestamp of the entry being tested.  If the
entry has no timestamp, or a timestamp that cannot be converted
into a date representation, return nil."
  (let ((timestamp (cdr (assoc-string "timestamp" entry))))
    (when (and timestamp
               (setq timestamp (ignore-errors (date-to-time timestamp))))
      (time-less-p date timestamp))))

   This function obtains the time stamp of the entry being tested from
the variable ‘entry’ and then tries to convert it to Emacs’ time format.
If successful, it compares this time to the date passed as an argument
and returns ‘t’ if the latter precedes the former.

8.2.6 Properties of Filtered Databases
--------------------------------------

When a filter is active, there are a few things that are not possible or
function differently.  First, it is not possible to add or delete
entries, either interactively or by merging or exporting.  Exporting
from a filtered database or saving a filtered database is also disabled.
Editing existing entries is possible, however.  Note that if the entry
doesn’t match the filter anymore after the edit, it doesn’t disappear
from view.  For that, you need to reapply the filter with ‘F r’.

   It is also possible to mark entries.  Marked entries stay marked when
you cancel the filter, so in order to do something with all the entries
matching a filter, you can mark them all in the filter view with ‘M’,
then cancel the filter and perform an action on them.

   If a database has an active filter, the save command is disabled,
because it would not be clear whether you want to save the entire
database or just the filtered entries.  If you want to save only the
filtered entries to a file, you can use the command ‘w’ (or the menu
option “Save Database As”).  This also saves the ‘@string’, ‘@preamble’
and ‘@comments’, as well as any file-local variables, so you will have a
self-contained ‘.bib’ file with only the filtered entries.  In order to
save the entire database, you need to cancel the filter.  After saving,
you can reapply the filter with ‘F L’, of course.

   One final note: of all the filter-related commands, ‘~’, ‘F c’, ‘F
r’, ‘F s’ and ‘F v’ are only available when a filter is active.  The
other commands operate on the stored filters and can be used when no
filter is active.

9 Accessing BibTeX Databases outside Ebib
*****************************************

When you’re in a text buffer, you can insert a citation with the command
‘ebib-insert-citation’.  This command asks for a key and inserts a
citation with that key in a (user-selectable) form that is appropriate
for the current buffer.  By default, this is set up for LaTeX and Pandoc
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) Markdown buffers, and for Org mode
(http://orgmode.org).

   When you invoke ‘ebib-insert-citation’, Emacs prompts you for a key
from the database(s) associated with the current buffer and for a
citation command to use.  You can use TAB completion when typing the
key.  If you have the ‘ivy’ package installed, however, Ebib uses a more
sophisticated method: instead of typing just the key, you can type
(parts of) the author name, publication year and title in order to find
the reference you wish to cite.

   You can define different citation commands for each type of file that
you use.  That is, you can have one set of citation commands for LaTeX
files, another set for Org files, etc.  For LaTeX buffers, the only
citation command that has been predefined is ‘cite’, which inserts a
citation of the form ‘\cite[arg]{key}’.  You may want to define more
commands.

   For Markdown buffers, three commands have been predefined: ‘text’,
which inserts a citation of the form ‘@Jones1992’, ‘paren’, which
inserts a citation of the form ‘[@Jones1992]’ and ‘year’, which inserts
‘[-@Jones1992]’.  Since these are the only types of citations that
Pandoc Markdown knows, you shouldn’t need to change anything.

   In Org buffers, citations are inserted in the form
‘[[ebib:<key>][<description>]]’.  You are prompted for the description,
which you have to provide yourself, unless you use the ‘ivy’ package, in
which case a default description is provided, which you can accept by
pressing ‘ENTER’.  If you use this type of Org link, you may want to
load the ‘org-ebib’ package, which allows you to open Ebib with
‘org-open-at-point’ (by default bound to ‘C-c C-o’).  This package also
enables you to create Org links to Ebib entries with ‘org-store-link’.

   Ebib also provides a way to insert citations into a buffer from
within Ebib.  If you’re in the index buffer and press ‘i’, Ebib asks you
for a buffer to insert the citation into (which defaults to the buffer
you started Ebib from, or the buffer you previously inserted an entry
into), a citation command and also any optional arguments, and then
inserts a citation at the current cursor position in the buffer you’ve
supplied.

   Both methods use the same sets of citation commands, which are
defined in the user option ‘ebib-citation-commands’.  You can customise
this option, as discussed below, *note Defining Citation Commands:
#defining-citation-commands.  For LaTeX, only the ‘\cite’ command is set
up by default, so you may want to add some commands.  For example, this
is what I use:

(setq ebib-citation-commands
      '((any
         (("cite"        "\\cite%<[%A]%>[%A]{%(%K%,)}")
          ("text"        "\\textcite%<[%A]%>[%A]{%(%K%,)}")
          ("paren"       "\\parencite%<[%A]%>[%A]{%(%K%,)}")
          ("author"      "\\citeauthor%<[%A]%>{%(%K%,)}")
          ("possauthor"  "\\possciteauthor%<[%A]%>{%K}")
          ("posstext"    "\\posstextcite%<[%A]%>{%K}")
          ("posscite"    "\\posscite%<[%A]%>{%K}")
          ("year"        "\\citeyear%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}")))
        (org-mode
         (("ebib"        "[[ebib:%K][%D]]")))
        (markdown-mode
         (("text"        "@%K%< [%A]%>")
          ("paren"       "[%(%<%A %>@%K%<, %A%>%; )]")
          ("year"        "[-@%K%< %A%>]")))))

   Calling Ebib from a text mode buffer has another small advantage.  If
point is on a BibTeX key when Ebib is called, it jumps to that entry in
your database.  This allows you to quickly check a reference in your
text.  Ebib will search the entry in the current database, or, if you’re
calling Ebib from a LaTeX file and there is a ‘\bibliography’ or
‘\addbibresource’ command in the file, in the databases in these
commands, if they are opened in Ebib, *note Associating a Database with
a LaTeX File: #associating-a-database-with-a-latex-file. below for
details.

   There is one more command that can be useful:
‘ebib-create-bib-from-bbl’ creates a ‘.bib’ file from the ‘.bbl’ file
associated with the LaTeX document in the current buffer.  This makes it
easy to create a ‘.bib’ file containing just the BibTeX entries that are
used in the document.  Note, however, that this command does not add
cross-referenced entries to the newly created ‘.bib’ file, nor does it
add ‘@String’ definitions and the ‘@Preamble’.  So make sure to add
those after using ‘ebib-create-bib-from-bbl’.

9.1 Key Bindings
================

Of course, the easiest way to use the commands discussed here is to bind
them to a key sequence.  For example, the following binds ‘C-c b’ to
‘ebib-insert-citation’ in AUCTeX’s LaTeX mode:

(define-key 'LaTeX-mode-map "\C-cb" 'ebib-insert-citation)

   Note that commands of the form ‘C-c <letter>’ are reserved for the
user, and should therefore not be set by any package.  For this reasons,
Ebib does not set this command itself.

   ‘ebib-insert-citation’ recognises the major mode of the buffer it is
called from and uses this information to determine which kinds of
citations to insert.  So you can bind the ‘ebib-insert-citation’ to the
same key sequence in every text mode in which you use citations and Ebib
will do the right thing.

9.2 Defining Citation Commands
==============================

As mentioned, you should probably set up some citation commands if you
use Ebib with LaTeX documents.  The customisation option that allows you
to do this is “Citation Commands”.

   Citation commands are defined for specific major modes.  You can also
define commands for all modes under the heading ‘any’.  (By default,
this option is used for LaTeX commands, since there is more than one
Emacs mode for (La)TeX). Each command consists of an identifier, which
you type when Ebib prompts you for a citation command, plus a format
string, which is used to create the actual citation command.

   The identifier should be a simple string which you can type easily
when Ebib asks you for a citation command (TAB completion is available,
though).  The format string can contain a few directives, which are used
to add the citation key and any optional arguments.  The following
directives are recognised:

‘%K’

     the entry key to be inserted.
‘%A’

     an argument, for which the user is prompted.
‘%<...%>’

     optional material surrounding a ‘%A’ directive.
‘%(...%<sep>)’

     a so-called _repeater_, which contains material that can be
     repeated.  If present, the repeater must contain the entry key
     directive ‘%K’.
‘%D’

     a description, for which the user is prompted.  Mainly for use in
     Org citations.

   In the simplest case, the format string contains just a ‘%K’
directive: ‘\cite{%K}’.  In this case, ‘%K’ is replaced with the
citation key and the result inserted.  Usually, however, citation
commands allow for optional arguments that are formatted as pre- or
postnotes to the citation.  For example, using the ‘natbib’ package, you
have citation commands available of the form:

\citet[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}

   In order to be able to insert such citations, the format string must
contain ‘%A’ directives:

\citet[%A][%A]{%K}

   With such a format string, Ebib asks the user to provide text for the
two arguments and inserts it at the locations specified by the
directives.  Of course, it is possible to leave the arguments empty (by
just hitting ‘RET’).  With the format string above, this would yield the
following citation in the LaTeX buffer:

\citet[][]{Jones1992}

   The empty brackets are completely harmless, because LaTeX will simply
ignore the empty arguments.  However, you may prefer for the brackets
not to appear if the arguments are empty.  In that case, you can wrap
the brackets and the ‘%A’ directives in a ‘%<...%>’ pair:

\citet%<[%A]%>%<[%A]%>{%K}

   Now, if you leave the arguments empty, Ebib produces the following
citation:

\citet{Jones1992}

   Note however, that this format string is problematic.  If you fill
out the first argument but not the second, Ebib produces the wrong
format string:

\citet[cf.]{Jones1992}

   If only one optional argument is provided, ‘natbib’ assumes that it
is a postnote, while what you intended is actually a prenote.
Therefore, it is best not to make the second argument optional:

\citet%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}

   This way, the second pair of brackets is always inserted, regardless
of whether you provide a second argument or not.

   ‘Natbib’ commands also accept multiple citation keys.  When you call
‘ebib-insert-citation’ from within a LaTeX buffer, you can only provide
one key, but when you’re in Ebib, you can mark multiple entry keys and
then use ‘i’ to insert them to a buffer.  In this case, Ebib asks you
for a separator and then inserts all keys into the position of ‘%K’:

\citet{Jones1992,Haddock2004}

   It is, however, also possible to specify in the format string that a
certain sequence can be repeated and how the different elements should
be separated.  This is done by wrapping that portion of the format
string that can be repeated in a ‘%(...%)’ pair.  Normally, you’ll want
to provide a separator, which is done by placing it between the ‘%’ and
the closing parenthesis:

\citet[%A][%A]{%(%K%,)}

   This format string says that the directive ‘%K’ can be repeated and
that multiple keys must be separated with a comma.  The advantage of
this is that you are no longer asked to provide a separator.

   It is also possible to put ‘%A’ directives in the repeating part.
This is useful for ‘biblatex’ package, which has so-called _multicite_
commands that take the following form:

\footcites[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}[][p. 201]{Haddock2004}

   Multicite commands can take more than one citation key in braces ‘{}’
and each of those citation keys can take two optional arguments in
brackets ‘[]’.  In order to get such citations, you can provide the
following format string:

\footcites%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Here, the entire sequence of two optional arguments and the
obligatory citation key is wrapped in ‘%(...%)’, so that Ebib knows it
can be repeated.  If you now mark multiple entries in Ebib, press ‘p’
and select the ‘footcites’ command, Ebib will put all the keys in the
citation, asking you for two arguments for each citation key.

   Of course it is also possible to combine parts that are repeated with
parts that are not repeated.  In fact, that already happens in the
previous example, because the part ‘\footcites’ is not repeated.  But
the part that is not repeated may contain ‘%A’ directives as well:

\footcites%<(%A)%>(%A)%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Multicite commands in ‘biblatex’ take two additional arguments
surrounded with parentheses.  These are pre- and postnotes for the
entire sequence of citations.  They can be accommodated as shown.

   Lastly, a citation command can also contain a ‘%D’ directive.  This
is mainly for use in Org citations, which take the form
‘[[ebib:<key>][<description>]]’.  The description is not an argument to
the citation command but the string that will be displayed in the Org
buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Associating a Database with a LaTeX File,  Prev: Defining Citation Commands,  Up: Accessing BibTeX Databases outside Ebib

9.3 Associating a Database with a LaTeX File
============================================

The commands ‘ebib-insert-citation’ and ‘ebib-entry-summary’ must
consult the database or databases loaded in Ebib, and Ebib tries to be
smart about which database(s) to consult.  Usually, a LaTeX file has a
‘\bibliography’ command somewhere toward the end, or an
‘\addbibresource’ command in the preamble, which names the ‘.bib’ file
or files that contain the bibliography entries.  If you consult a BibTeX
database from within a LaTeX file, Ebib first looks for one of these
commands, reads the names of the ‘.bib’ file(s) from it, and then sees
if those files happen to be open.  If they are, Ebib uses them to let
you pick an entry key (in the case of ‘ebib-insert-entry-key’) or to
search for the entry (in the case of ‘ebib-entry-summary’).

   Of course, it may be the case that the LaTeX file is actually part of
a bigger project, and that only the master file contains a
‘\bibliography’ or ‘\addbibresource’ command.  To accommodate for this,
Ebib checks whether the (buffer-local) variable ‘TeX-master’ is set to a
filename.  If it is, it reads that file and tries to find the relevant
command there.  (Note: ‘TeX-master’ is an AUCTeX variable, which is used
to keep track of multi-file projects.  If you don’t use AUCTeX, this
functionality doesn’t work, and Ebib will only check the current file
for a ‘\bibliography’ or ‘\addbibresource’ command.)

   Note that if one of the ‘.bib’ files in the ‘\bibliography’ or
‘\addbibresource’ command isn’t loaded, Ebib issues a warning message
about this, and continues to check for the next ‘.bib’ file.  These
warning messages appear in the minibuffer, but are probably directly
overwritten again by further messages or prompts Ebib produces, so check
the ‘*Messages*’ buffer if Ebib doesn’t seem to be able to find an entry
that you’re sure is in one of your databases.

   Another thing to keep in mind is that Ebib only looks for a
‘\bibliography’ or ‘\addbibresource’ command once: the first time either
‘ebib-insert-bibtex-entry’ or ‘ebib-entry-summary’ is called.  It stores
the result of this search and uses it the next time either of these
commands is used.  Therefore, if you make a change to the bibliography
command, you must reload the file (use ‘M-x revert-buffer’ or ‘C-x C-v
RET’) to make sure Ebib rereads the bibliography command.

   If no ‘\bibliography’ or ‘\addbibresource’ command is found at all,
either in the LaTeX file itself, or in the master file, Ebib simply
consults the current database, i.e. the database that was active when
Ebib was lowered with ‘z’.  This is also what Ebib does for Org mode or
Pandoc Markdown files, since they do not have the equivalent of a
bibliography command.  (Note, however, that you can set
‘ebib-local-bibtex-filenames’ to a list of ‘.bib’ files in the
file-local variable section of a file.)

10 Cross-referencing
********************

Both BibTeX and Biblatex have a cross-referencing facility.  Suppose you
have an entry ‘Jones1998’, which appeared in a book that is also in your
database, say under ‘Miller1998’.  You can tell Bib(La)TeX that
‘Jones1998’ is contained in ‘Miller1998’ by putting ‘Miller1998’ in the
‘crossref’ field.  When Bib(La)TeX finds such a cross-reference, all the
fields of ‘Jones1998’ that don’t have a value inherit their values from
‘Miller1998’.  At the very least, this saves you some typing, but more
importantly, if two or more entries cross-reference the same entry,
Bib(La)TeX automatically includes the cross-referenced entry in the
bibliography (and puts a reduced reference in the cross-referencing
entries).

   When you fill in the ‘crossref’ field in Ebib, Ebib displays the
values of the cross-referenced entry in the entry buffer.  To indicate
that they are just inherited values, they are marked with
‘ebib-crossref-face’, which by default inherits from
‘font-lock-comment-face’.  (You can customise it, of course.  See the
customisation option “Crossref Face”.)  These values are merely
displayed for convenience: they cannot be edited.  (They can be copied,
however).

   BibTeX inheritance mechanism is rather crude: cross-referencing
entries simply inherit the fields of the same name from the
cross-referenced entry.  Biblatex’s mechanism is more sophisticated.
Biblatex inheritance rules depend on the field and on the types of the
cross-referencing _and_ the cross-referenced entry.  Thus it is possible
to specify that the ‘inbook’ entry type can inherit a ‘maintitle’ field
from the ‘title’ field if the cross-referenced entry is of type
‘mvbook’, and a ‘booktitle’ field if the cross-referenced entry is of
type ‘book’.  The inheritance scheme for Biblatex is defined by the
option “Biblatex Inheritances”, which is set up with the default
inheritance relations defined by Biblatex, but which can be customised
if needed.

   If you’re viewing an entry that has a cross-reference and you want to
go to the cross-referenced entry you can type ‘C’.  This command reads
the value of the ‘crossref’ field and then displays that entry.  If you
want to do the reverse, i.e., see if the current entry is
cross-referenced by any other entries, you can use the same key ‘C’: if
you type ‘C’ on an entry that does not have a cross-reference, Ebib
makes the key of the current entry the current search string and
searches for its first occurrence after the current entry.  Note that
after Ebib has jumped to the first cross-referencing entry, you cannot
type ‘C’ again to find the next one.  (Instead, it would take you back
to the cross-referenced entry.)  In order to find the next
cross-referencing entry, you have to type ‘n’, as with a normal search.
(Also, if the cross-referenced entry appears alphabetically before the
cross-referencing entry, you need to type ‘g’ and then ‘/’.)

   Note that if you want to use Bib(La)TeX’s cross-referencing options,
the option “Save Xrefs first” needs to be set (which it is by default).
This tells Ebib to save all entries with a ‘crossref’ field first in the
‘.bib’ file.  Without this, cross-referencing will not work reliably.

11 Marking Entries
******************

Commands in the index buffer generally operate on one single entry, or
on all entries.  For some commands, however, it may sometimes be useful
to perform them on more than one entry, but not necessarily all of them.
This can be achieved by selecting entries.  You can select the entries
you want to perform a command on with the key ‘m’.  This selects (or
unselects) the current entry.  Selected entries are highlighted.  (Note
that the face properties of selected entries can be customised through
the customisation option “Selected Face”.)

   Commands for which it makes sense automatically operate on all marked
entries if there are any.  Of the commands discussed so far, these are
‘d’ to delete entries and ‘p’ to push entries to a LaTeX buffer.  (Note
that Ebib creates a single citation command with commas separating the
entry keys.)

   The command ‘M’ unmarks all entries or, if there are no marked
entries, marks all entries in the current database.

12 Printing the Database
************************

Sometimes it may be useful to have a ‘.pdf’ file or print-out of your
database.  Although Ebib does not actually do the printing itself, it
can create a LaTeX file for you that you can compile and print.  In
fact, there are two ways of doing this.

   The print options are available in the Ebib menu when the index
buffer is active.  You can print the entries as index cards or as a
bibliography.

   If you print your entries as a bibliography, Ebib creates a simple
LaTeX document that essentially contains a ‘\nocite{*}’ command followed
by a ‘\bibliography’ command referring to the ‘.bib’ file belonging to
the current database.  You can then run the usual sequence of LaTeX,
BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX on this file, creating a document containing a list
of all the references in your database.

   If you choose to print as index cards, Ebib also creates a LaTeX
file.  However, instead of simply providing a ‘\nocite{*}’ command, this
file contains a ‘tabular’ environment for each entry in the database
listing all the fields of that entry and their values.

   The entries are separated by a ‘\bigskip’, but if you set the option
‘Print Newpage’ in the customisation buffer (or in the Print menu), the
entries are separated by a ‘\newpage’, so that every entry is on a
separate page.  The latter option is useful when printing actual index
cards (though you’d probably have to change the page size with the
‘geometry’ package as well).

   By default, the index cards only show single-line field values.  That
is, multiline values are normally excluded.  If you want to include
multiline values in the print-out, you have to set the option ‘Print
Multiline’ in the Options menu or in Ebib’s customisation buffer.  With
this option set, Ebib includes all multiline values in the LaTeX file
that it creates.  Note however that Ebib does not change anything about
the formatting of the text in a multiline value.  So if you plan to make
(heavy) use of this option, make sure that the way you type your text
conforms to LaTeX’s conventions (e.g. empty lines to mark paragraphs,
etc.)  and doesn’t contain any characters such as ‘&’ that are illegal
in LaTeX. (Or, alternatively, use LaTeX code in your multiline fields.)

   As mentioned, when you “print” the database, Ebib really just creates
a LaTeX file.  More precisely, it creates a temporary buffer and writes
the LaTeX code into it, and then saves the contents of that buffer to a
file.  After it has done that, Ebib lowers itself and instruct Emacs to
open the file in a buffer, which will then be properly set up as a LaTeX
buffer.  From there you can run LaTeX and view the result.

   Before doing all this, Ebib asks you which file to write to.  Be
careful with this: since this is supposed to be a temporary file, Ebib
simply assumes that if you provide a filename of an existing file, it
can overwrite that file without warning!

   A better way to tell Ebib which file to use is to set the option
“Print Tempfile” in Ebib’s customisation buffer to some temporary file.
When this option is set, Ebib will always use this file to write to, and
will not ask you for a filename anymore.

   Note that both print options operate on all entries of the database
or on the selected entries.

   There are two more customisation options for printing the database.
These are “Print Preamble” and “LaTeX Preamble”.  With these options,
you can specify what Ebib should put in the preamble of the LaTeX files
it creates.  Use this if you want to use specific packages.  This is
especially useful for printing a bibliography, since by default, Ebib
uses BibTeX’s standard bibliography style.  With the option “LaTeX
Preamble” you can set your preferred bibliography style.

13 Calling a Browser
********************

With most scientific literature nowadays being available on-line, it is
common to store URLs and DOIs in a BibTeX database.  (Biblatex of course
has standardised fields for this information.)  Sometimes you may want
to load such a URL or a DOI in your browser.  Ebib provides a convenient
way for doing so.

   If you type ‘u’ in the index buffer, Ebib takes the URL stored in the
‘url’ field of the current entry and passes it to your browser.
Furthermore, in the entry buffer, you can use ‘u’ on _any_ field.  If
you happen to have more than one URL stored in the relevant field, Ebib
will ask you which one you want to open.  Alternatively, you can use a
prefix argument: typing ‘M-2 u’ sends the second URL to your browser.

   It is not even necessary that the relevant field contains _only_
URLs.  It may contain other text mixed with the URLs: Ebib simply
searches the URLs in the field and ignores the rest of the text.  Ebib
considers every string of characters that starts with ‘http://’ or
‘https://’ and that does not contain whitespace or any of the characters
‘" ' ; <’ or ‘>’ as a URL. The semicolon is included here even though it
is actually a valid character in URLs.  This is done for consistency,
because the semicolon (actually, semicolon+space) is the standard
separator for files in the ‘file’ field and in this way, you can use the
same separator to distinguish multiple URLs in the ‘url’ field.  By
default Ebib also regards everything that is enclosed in a LaTeX
‘\url{...}’ command as a URL. So if you use ‘;’ to separate URLs and
then happen to run into a URL that contains a semicolon, you can enclose
it in ‘\url{...}’ and it will be recognised properly.  You can, of
course, customise the regular expression that controls this behaviour.
See the option “Url Regexp” for details.

   Similarly, with the key ‘i’ in the index buffer you can send a DOI to
a browser.  The DOI must be stored in the ‘doi’ field.  Unlike URLs,
there can only be one DOI in this field.  The whole contents of the
field is assumed to be the DOI and is sent to the browser.  Ebib adds
the URL ‘http://dx.doi.org/’ before sending the DOI to the browser, so
the ‘doi’ field should contain just the DOI itself.

   Ebib uses the Emacs function ‘browse-url’ to call the default browser
on the system.  If you prefer to use another browser, however, you can
specify this with the option “Browser Command”.  You can also customise
the field that Ebib takes URLs from, with the option “Standard Url
Field”.  The same can be done for the DOI field.

14 Viewing Files
****************

If you have electronic versions of the papers in your database stored on
your computer, or any other file associated with your entries (e.g.,
notes, if you store those in separate files) you can use Ebib to call
external viewers for these files or have them opened in Emacs.  The
interface for this is similar to that for calling a browser: if you
press ‘f’ in the index buffer, Ebib searches the ‘file’ field for a
filename and when it finds one, calls an appropriate viewer.  And just
as with ‘u’, you can use ‘f’ in the entry buffer as well, in which case
it can be used on any field, not just the ‘file’ field.  It is also
possible to have more than one filename in a field.  In that case, Ebib
asks you which one you want to open.  If you want to open the first one
you can just hit ENTER. Alternatively, you can provide a prefix
argument: ‘M-2 f’ for the second file, etc.

   The file names in the ‘file’ field do not have to have full paths.
You can set the option “File Search Dirs” to a list of directories that
Ebib should search when opening a file from the ‘file’ field.  Note that
Ebib searches only the directories in this list, not their
subdirectories.  However, you can specify a relative path in the ‘file’
field: if you put something like ‘a/Abney1987.pdf’ in the ‘file’ field,
Ebib searches for the relevant file in a subdirectory ‘a/’ of the
directories listed in the option “File Search Dirs”.  As an extra
service, Ebib also searches for the base filename, i.e., ‘Abney1987’ in
this particular case.

   Ebib can call different external programs depending on the file
extension of the relevant file.  The option “File Associations” allows
you to specify which programs to call for which types of files.  By
default, ‘.pdf’ and ‘.ps’ files are handled, by ‘xpdf’ and ‘gv’,
respectively.  You can specify further file types by their extensions
(do not include the dot).  The program is searched for in ‘PATH’, but
you can of course specify the full path to the program.  There is also
the option to open files in Emacs.  Use this if you have separate text
files for notes, or if you want to read pdf files in Emacs with
‘doc-view-mode’.

   If the ‘file’ field is empty, Ebib will search for a pdf file with a
name based on the entry key.  By default, Ebib just appends ‘.pdf’ to
the entry key and tries to find a file by the name thus created.  If you
want, you can modify the file name that Ebib searches for by setting the
option ‘ebib-name-transform-function’ to a function that performs the
transformation.  This function takes the key of the current entry as its
argument (as a string), and should return the file name to use (without
‘.pdf’, which is added automatically).

   For example, if your entry keys separate authors with colons (i.e.,
you have keys of the form ‘Hauser:Chomsky:Fitch2002’), but your pdf
files have underscores (i.e., ‘Hauser_Chomsky_Fitch2002.pdf’), then you
can set ‘ebib-name-transform-function’ to:

(lambda (key) (replace-regexp-in-string ":" "_" key))

   Note that you can also use ‘ebib-name-transform-function’ to add a
subdirectory to the file name.  For example, if you store the pdf files
in subdirectories ‘A/’ to ‘Z/’ corresponding to the first letter of the
file name, you can use the following function:

(lambda (key) (format "%c/%s" (aref key 0) key))

   For the entry key ‘Chomsky1995’, this produces ‘C/Chomsky1995’, which
is then appended with the extension ‘.pdf’.

   Of course, the function in ‘ebib-name-transform-function’ does not
have to be a lambda.  It can also be the name of a function that you’ve
defined for the purpose.

* Editing the file field::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing the file field,  Up: Viewing Files

14.1 Editing the ‘file’ field
=============================

As mentioned above, editing the ‘file’ field is a bit different from
editing other fields.  Instead of typing the full contents of the file
field, you are asked to specify a single file name.  When you hit ENTER,
Ebib adds the filename to the ‘file’ field, appending it no any existing
contents (adding a separator if necessary), and then asks you for the
next file.  If you don’t want to add another, just hit ENTER. The
default separator is ‘"; "’ (semicolon-space), but this can be
customised (see the option “Filename Separator” for details).  The
advantage of this method is that you can use TAB completion to complete
file names.

   The first directory in the option “File Search Dirs” is used as the
starting directory for filename completion when editing the ‘file’
field.  Note that when completing file names, Ebib does not take the
directories in “File Search Dirs” into account: completion is done using
the standard Emacs file name completion mechanism.  However, when you
enter a file name, Ebib checks if it is in a (subdirectory of) one of
the directories in “File Search Dirs”, and if so, cuts off the relevant
part of the file name to turn it into a relative path.  (You can disable
this behaviour with the option ‘ebib-truncate-file-names’: if unset,
file names are always stored as absolute paths.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Notes files,  Next: Managing a reading list,  Prev: Viewing Files,  Up: Top

15 Notes files
**************

Ebib supports the ‘annote’ (or ‘annotation’) field, but if you prefer to
keep notes outside the ‘.bib’ file, there is an easy way to do that as
well.  When you hit ‘N’ on an entry in the index buffer, Ebib creates a
note for the entry, which is saved in a separate file.  If an entry
already has a note associated with it, ‘N’ opens it.  The mode line of
the entry buffer indicates whether an entry has a note associated with
it by displaying the string ‘[N]’ (customisable with
‘ebib-notes-symbol’).

   By default, each note is saved to its own file, but you can also use
a single file to store all notes.  If you wish to use separate files for
each note, you need to configure the directory in which to store them by
setting the option ‘ebib-notes-directory’.  If this is not set, Ebib
uses the first directory in ‘ebib-file-search-dirs’, (which defaults to
the user’s home directory).

   The name of a notes file is formed by taking the entry’s key and
appending the extension ‘.org’ to it, which means that a notes file is
an Org file.  Before creating the file name, Ebib applies the function
in ‘ebib-notes-name-transform-function’ to it, or, if this is not set,
the function in ‘ebib-name-transform-function’.  See *note Viewing
Files: #viewing-files. for some examples of the changes that can be
applied.  Note that if you do not wish to apply any changes but also do
not want the function in ‘ebib-name-transform-function’ to be applied,
you can set ‘ebib-notes-name-transform-function’ to ‘identity’.

   When a new note is created, it is given a title consisting of the
author(s), year and title of the entry.  Ebib also includes a
‘:PROPERTIES:’ block containing a custom ID for the entry, which
consists of the entry key.  This initial contents is based on a
template, which can be customised.  See below for details.

   As mentioned, notes files are Org files by default.  This can be
changed by customising the option ‘ebib-notes-file-extension’.  If you
change this, it makes sense to change ‘ebib-notes-template’ as well,
since the template is an Org template.

   If you wish to store all notes in a single file, you must set the
option ‘ebib-notes-use-single-file’ to the notes file.  In this case,
the options ‘ebib-notes-directory’ and ‘ebib-notes-extension’ are
ignored, which means that you must specify the full path and the
extension of the notes file.  The option
‘ebib-notes-name-transform-function’ is also ignored.

   Ebib assumes that the notes file is an Org file and creates notes
using the template in ‘ebib-notes-template’, but the Org format is not
enforced.  If you specify a notes file with an extension different from
‘.org’, the corresponding format will be used, which probably requires
customising the template (see below for details).

   There are three hooks that can be used to change the way the notes
file is displayed when a note is opened.  When an existing note is
displayed, the hook ‘ebib-notes-open-note-after-hook’ is run.  By
default, this contains two functions: ‘org-back-to-header’, which puts
point at the start of the note, and ‘org-narrow-to-subtree’, which
narrows the notes buffer to just the note you’re viewing.

   When a new note is created, the hook ‘ebib-notes-new-note-hook’ is
run.  By default, this contains the function ‘org-narrow-to-subtree’.
For a new note, the cursor is positioned after the title and the
‘:PROPERTIES:’ block, so that you can start typing right away.

   Because both these hooks narrow the notes buffer, there must be a way
to widen the buffer again when searching for another note.  This is the
purpose of ‘ebib-notes-search-note-before-hook’.  This hook is run every
time Ebib searches a note (to see if it exists or to open it) and by
default contains the function ‘widen’, so that the entire buffer is
searched.

   All three hooks are customisable.  For example, if you prefer not to
narrow the buffer, simply remove the corresponding functions from the
hooks.
* Menu:

* Customising the notes template::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Customising the notes template,  Up: Notes files

15.1 Customising the notes template
===================================

By default, each note is an Org entry whose header consists of the
author or editor, the year of publication and the title.  The entry has
a ‘:PROPERTIES:’ block containing a ‘Custom_id:’.  This initial contents
is created on the basis of a template, which has the following form:

"* %T
:PROPERTIES:
%K
:END:
>|<
"

   This template contains two format specifiers: ‘%K’ and ‘%T’.  ‘%K’ is
replaced with the key of the entry prepended with the string
‘"Custom_id: "’ in order to create an Org property.  The ‘%T’ specifier
is replaced with the title of the note, which consists of the author (or
editor), the year of publication and the title of the bibliography
entry.  The template also contains the string ‘">|<"’, which indicates
the position of the cursor when a new note is created.

   It is possible to change the template by customising the option
‘ebib-notes-template’.  Note that if you do this, the ‘%K’ directive
should not be removed.  It is required in order to identify the note and
connect it to its BibTeX entry.  Without it, Ebib won’t be able to tell
whether a BibTeX entry has a note or not.  The ‘%T’ directive and the
cursor indicator may be left out.

   There are in fact a few more specifiers that may be used in the
template: ‘%F’ creates a link to the file in the BibTeX entry’s ‘file’
field, ‘%D’ creates a link to the DOI in the entry’s ‘doi’ field, and
‘%U’ a link to the entry’s ‘url’ field.  There is also a ‘%L’ specifier,
which creates a link to the entry’s file, its DOI, or its URL, whichever
is found first.

   It is possible to change the strings that the specifiers produce by
customising ‘ebib-notes-template-specifiers’.  This option contains
pairs of characters and functions.  Each function takes two arguments,
‘key’ and ‘db’, the key of the entry for which a note is created and the
database in which it is stored.  It should return a string (possibly
empty), which replaces the specifier in the template.  In order to
change the string that a specifier is replaced with, write your own
function and set ‘ebib-notes-template-specifiers’ to use it.

   It is also possible to add new specifiers.  Simply add a pair (cons
cell) ‘(<char> . <function>)’ to ‘ebib-notes-template-specifiers’.  The
character should obviously be unique (just supply the character, without
‘%’), and the function should take the key and the database as arguments
and return a string.

   When the specifier functions are called, the ‘key’ argument is set to
the key of the current entry and the ‘db’ argument to the current
database.  With these arguments, it is possible to, e.g., retrieve the
value of a specific field in the entry:

(ebib-get-field-value <field> key db 'noerror 'unbraced 'xref)

   where ‘<field>’ is the field (as a string) whose value is to be
retrieved.

   Instead of a function, you may also provide a variable.  The
variable’s value is then used to replace the specifier.

16 Managing a reading list
**************************

Ebib offers the ability to manage a reading list as an Org file.  In
order to make use of this functionality, you must set the option
‘ebib-reading-list’ to a file in which the reading list is stored.  Once
you’ve specified a file, you can add the current entry to the reading
list with ‘R a’.  The mode line of the entry buffer will show ‘[R]’ to
indicate that the current entry is on the reading list.

   A reading list is simply an Org file with one entry (i.e., heading)
per item.  Each entry is marked with ‘TODO’, so that the items can be
included in the Org agenda.  If you prefer to use another todo state,
you can customise the option ‘ebib-reading-list-todo-marker’.

   You can mark an entry as done from within Ebib with the key ‘R d’.
This will change the todo state of the item to ‘DONE’ (or whatever the
value of ‘ebib-reading-list-done-marker’).  With ‘R v’ you can view the
reading list.

   The format of a reading list item can be customised in much the same
way that notes are.  The default template for reading list items is
provided by the option ‘ebib-reading-list-template’, and the specifiers
that can be used in this template are in
‘ebib-reading-list-template-specifiers’.  Most of the specifiers are the
same as for the notes template, with the exception of ‘%K’.  For the
reading list, this specifier uses a different function, which adds a
prefix ‘reading_’ to the key.  In this way, the custom ID of a reading
list item and a note will not interfere.  Furthermore, the reading list
template accepts a specifier ‘%M’, which is replaced with the todo
marker specified in the option ‘ebib-reading-list-todo-marker’ (by
default ‘TODO’).

   If you do not wish to use an Org file for the reading list, you can
do so.  Apart from customising the template, there are several other
options that will need to be customised in this case.  First, the option
‘ebib-reading-list-remove-item-function’ holds the function that marks a
reading list item as done.  By default, it is set to
‘ebib-reading-list-mark-item-as-done’, which simply changes the todo
state of the item to ‘DONE’, but you can set it to a function that does
something else (for example, completely removing the entry from the
list).  You will also have to customise
‘ebib-reading-list-item-active-function’, which holds a function that
should return ‘t’ if the current entry is on the reading list (and still
active).  The default function simply checks if the entry’s todo state
is equal to ‘ebib-reading-list-todo-marker’, but if you don’t use an Org
file, you will need a different function, obviously.

   Lastly, there are two hooks, ‘ebib-reading-list-new-item-hook’ and
‘ebib-reading-list-remove-item-hook’.  The former is run immediately
after a new reading list item is inserted in the reading list file (but
before saving it), the latter immediately after calling the function in
‘ebib-reading-list-remove-item-function’ (also before saving the
buffer).  By default, these hooks are empty.

17 Window Management
********************

By default, Ebib takes over the entire Emacs frame it is started in,
displaying the index window at the top and the entry window below it.
There are a few options to change this behaviour, however.  They are all
part of the customisation group ‘ebib-windows’, and allow you to specify
two alternative ways to deal with Ebib windows.  The main layout option
is simply called “Layout” and has four options: use the full frame (the
default), use the current window, use the right part of the frame, or
display only the index window.

   If you set the layout to use only the right part of the frame, the
Ebib buffers are displayed on the right of the frame, with the (usually
larger) left part of the frame displaying some other buffer, normally
the buffer from which you called Ebib.  The width of the Ebib windows
can be set with the option “Width”, which defaults to 80, and which can
be specified as an absolute value (the number of columns), but also as a
value relative to the current window.  In that case, you must specify a
value between 0 and 1.  Note that when this option is used, the key ‘z’
does not hide the Ebib buffers, it simply switches to a non-Ebib window
in the same frame.  You can use (uppercase) ‘Z’ to hide the Ebib
buffers.  Furthermore, with this option, the multiline edit buffer is
not displayed in the same window as the entry buffer.  Rather, Ebib uses
another, non-Ebib window to display it.

   The fourth option that Ebib provides is to only show the index buffer
on start-up.  In this case, Ebib does not display the entry buffer when
it is started.  Instead, only the index buffer is displayed, which can
be navigated in the usual manner.  The entry buffer is only displayed
when you add or edit an entry.  When you’ve finished editing and move
back to the index buffer, the entry buffer is hidden again.

   The entry buffer is also displayed if you press ‘RET’.  When you do
this, the index buffer remains selected, so you can use this to display
the fields of an entry without moving focus to the entry window.  If you
navigate the index buffer, the entry buffer remains visible, updating
its contents as you move around.

   In this case, too, the key ‘z’ does not hide the index window.
Rather, it just selects another, non-Ebib window.  In order to hide the
index window, you can use (uppercase) ‘Z’.

   If you set Ebib’s layout to display only the index buffer on startup,
you can additionally set the option “Popup Entry Window”.  Normally,
Ebib will reuse an existing window to display the entry buffer (and
restore its original buffer when you leave the entry buffer).  With this
option set, however, Ebib uses the Emacs function
‘display-buffer-popup-window’ to create a new window (which is destroyed
again when you leave the entry buffer).

   Further relevant options are “Window Vertical Split”, which displays
the index buffer to the left of the frame rather than at the top, and
“Index Window Size”, which determines the size of the index window
(either its height or its width, depending on whether the index window
is displayed at the top or on the left of the frame.)

18 Creating Entry Stubs
***********************

If you have a directory full of (pdf) files of articles that you want to
add to your database, Ebib can make the task a little bit easier by
creating entry stubs for all the files.  You can do this with the
command ‘M-x ebib-add-file-entry’.  This command asks you for a file or
a directory and creates an entry in the current database for that file
or each file in the directory.  The entries only contain a file field
pointing to the file, all the other information still has to be filled
out by hand, but this way you can at least keep track of which files are
already in your database.

   Note that the entry keys for the stubs are temporary keys.  They will
be replaced by more permanent keys automatically when you edit the
entries.  This behaviour is controlled by the function
‘bibtex-generate-autokey’, which has a number of customisation options.
Check out its doc string for details.  If you prefer to edit the keys by
hand, you can do so by pressing ‘E’ in the index buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @Preamble Definition,  Next: @String Definitions,  Prev: Creating Entry Stubs,  Up: Top

19 @Preamble Definition
***********************

Apart from database entries, BibTeX allows three more types of elements
to appear in a ‘.bib’ file.  These are ‘@comment’, ‘@preamble’ and
‘@string’ definitions.  Ebib provides facilities to handle these, which
are discussed here and in the following sections.

   Ebib allows you to add one ‘@preamble’ definition to the database.
In principle, BibTeX allows more than one such definition, but really
one suffices, because you can use the concatenation character ‘#’ to
include multiple TeX or LaTeX commands.  So, rather than having two
‘@preamble’ definitions such as:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " }
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   you can write this in your ‘.bib’ file:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} "
         # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   Creating or editing a ‘@preamble’ definition in Ebib is done by
hitting (uppercase) ‘P’ in the index buffer.  Ebib uses the multiline
edit buffer for editing the text of the ‘@preamble’ definition, which
means that ‘C-c | q’ stores the ‘@preamble’ text and returns focus to
the index buffer, while ‘C-c | c’ returns focus to the index buffer
while abandoning any changes you may have made.  (For details on using
multiline edit buffers, see *note Multiline Edit Buffers:
#multiline-edit-buffers.)

   In order to create a ‘@preamble’ as shown above in Ebib, you only
have to type the text between the braces.  Ebib takes care of including
the braces of the ‘@preamble’ command, but otherwise it saves the text
exactly as you enter it.  So in order to get the preamble above, you’d
have to type the following in Ebib:

"\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} "

   Note that when Ebib loads a ‘.bib’ file that contains more than one
‘@preamble’ definition, it concatenates all the strings in them in the
manner just described and saves them in one ‘@preamble’ definition.

20 @String Definitions
**********************

If you press (uppercase) ‘S’ in the index buffer, Ebib hides the entry
buffer in the lower window and replaces it with the _strings buffer_.
In this buffer, you can add, delete and edit ‘@string’ definitions.

   Adding a ‘@string’ definition is done with the command ‘a’.  This
will first ask you for an abbreviation and then for the value to be
associated with that abbreviation.  Once you’ve entered these, Ebib will
sort the new abbreviation into the buffer.

   Moving between the ‘@string’ definitions can be done in the usual
way: the cursor keys ‘up’ and ‘down’, ‘p’ and ‘n’ or ‘C-p’ and ‘C-n’
move up and down.  ‘Space’ and ‘PgDn’ move ten strings down, while ‘b’
and ‘PgUp’ move in the other direction.  The keys ‘g’, ‘G’, ‘Home’ and
‘End’ also function as expected.

   To delete a ‘@string’ definition, use ‘d’.  To edit the value of a
definition, use ‘e’.  There is also a command ‘c’, which copies the
value of the current ‘@string’ definition to the kill ring.  Unlike in
the entry buffer, there are no corresponing commands ‘y’ and ‘x’.  (In
fact, ‘x’ does exist, but has another function.)  Yanking from the kill
ring can be done with ‘C-y/M-y’ in the minibuffer when you edit a
‘@string’’s value.  Cutting a ‘@string’’s value is pointless, because a
‘@string’ definition must have a value.

   Having defined ‘@string’ definitions, there must of course be a way
to use them.  Just giving a field a string abbreviation as value will
not do, because Ebib puts braces around the value that you enter when it
writes the ‘.bib’ file, so that BibTeX will not recognise the
abbreviation, and will not expand it.  BibTeX will only recognise an
abbreviation if it appears in the ‘.bib’ file outside of any braces.

   To accomplish this, you must mark a field’s value as special.  A
special field is a field whose value is not surrounded by braces when
the database is saved, so that BibTeX recognises it as an abbreviation.
To mark a field special, press ‘r’.  An asterisk will appear before the
field, indicating that has no braces.  Pressing ‘r’ again will change
the field back to normal.  If you press ‘r’ on a field that does not
have a value yet, Ebib will ask you for one.

   Note that this also makes it possible to enter field values that are
composed of concatenations of strings and abbreviations.  The BibTeX
documentation for example explains that if you have defined:

@string{WGA = "World Gnus Almanac"}

   you can create a BibTeX field like this:

title = 1966 # WGA

   which will produce “1966 World Gnus Almanac”.  Or you can do:

month = "1~" # jan

   which will produce someting like “1 January”, assuming your
bibliography style has defined the abbreviation ‘jan’.  All this is
possible with Ebib, simply by entering the exact text including quotes
or braces around the strings, and marking the relevant field as special.

   An easy way to enter a ‘@string’ abbreviation as a field value is to
use the key ‘s’ instead of ‘e’.  If you type ‘s’, Ebib asks you for a
‘@string’ abbreviation to put in the current field, and automatically
marks the field as special.  With this command, Ebib only accepts
‘@string’ definitions that are in the database, so that by using ‘s’ you
can make sure you don’t make any typos.  Note that you can use TAB
completion to complete a partial string.

21 @Comments
************

If Ebib finds a ‘@comment’ in a ‘.bib’ file, it will read it and store
it in the database.  When the database is saved, all the ‘@comment’s
will be saved with it, at the top of the file (right after the
‘@preamble’.)  There is no way to edit comments, nor can you specify
where in the ‘.bib’ file a comment is placed, but they won’t be lost.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Managing Keywords,  Next: Sorting the bib File,  Prev: @Comments,  Up: Top

22 Managing Keywords
********************

Ebib provides some special functionality for handling keywords.  By
default, there is a ‘keywords’ field in the list of extra fields.
Editing this field is a bit different from other fields.  Instead of
just entering a string and hitting ENTER to store it and return to the
entry buffer, you should enter a single keyword and hit enter.  The
keyword will then be added to the keywords already present and you are
asked to enter the next keyword.  If you’ve added all keywords you want,
just hit ENTER to finish.

   The advantage of doing it this way is that you can reuse keywords:
once you’ve added a keyword to one entry, Ebib remembers it.  The next
time you want to use the same keyword for a different entry, you just
need to type the first (few) letters, hit TAB and the keyword will be
completed.  That makes it easier to ensure you use the exact same
keywords in different entries.  Note that Ebib’s keyword functionality
is not used to check the contents of keyword fields.  It is simply a way
to make it easier to stick to specific keywords, which should make it
easier to categorise and search your entries.

   It is still possible to edit the ‘keywords’ field directly.  To do
so, use a prefix argument: ‘C-u e’ (or any other prefix argument) on the
‘keywords’ field will allow you to edit the entire contents in the
normal way.  Use this method if you want to remove single keywords.
(Blanking the entire ‘keywords’ field is quicker with ‘x’ or ‘d’.)

   It is also possible to add keywords to an entry from the index
buffer, using the command ‘K a’ (‘ebib-keywords-add’).  This works
essentially the same way as when adding keywords from the entry buffer.
There is one advantage, however: this command can also operate on marked
entries, so that you can add keywords to multiple entries in one go.

   Remembering keywords is practical, but it is even more useful if
remembered keywords can be saved, so that they are available the next
time you start Ebib.  There are two ways of doing this: first, there is
an option “Keywords List” that you can use to store keywords.  Keywords
stored in this option will be available for TAB completion to all
databases in Ebib.  New keywords, however, will not automatically be
stored.  If you find you need a keyword not on the list and want to make
it permanent, you’ll have to add it to “Keywords List” yourself.

   The other way of making keywords permanent is by storing them in a
file.  Ebib offers two ways of doing this (which are mutually exclusive,
so you have to choose one).  You can either configure a single keyword
file, with keywords that are available to all databases, or you can
configure per-directory keyword files, with keywords that are available
for all ‘.bib’ files in the same directory.  You can set up keyword
files by configuring the option “Keywords File”.  You can either set it
to use a single keyword file, in which case you need to specify a file
with its full path, or you can use per-directory keyword files, in which
case you must provide a filename without a path.  That is, if you use
per-directory keyword files, the files have the same name in each
directory.  The default name is ‘ebib-keywords.txt’, but you can change
that if you like, of course.

   Keywords that have not been made permanent are marked as such in the
entry buffer in ‘ebib-warning-face’, (usually a red foreground colour,
but this can be customised).  If you run into such keywords and want to
make them permanent, use the command ‘K s’.  This will take the keywords
in the ‘keywords’ field of the current entry and store all keywords that
are not permanent yet.

   Keyword files have a very simple format: they are text files with one
keyword per line.  So you can easily create or edit keyword files by
hand, or have them created by some other programme.  Keep in mind,
though, that Ebib does not check for changes to keyword files.  If you
have a single keyword file, it is loaded when Ebib starts up;
per-directory keyword files are loaded when the first ‘.bib’ file in
that directory is opened.  If you open a second ‘.bib’ file from the
same directory, Ebib won’t reload the keywords file.

   When you close a database, Ebib checks if you have added new keywords
to it and asks you if you want to save them.  You can tell Ebib to save
new keywords automatically by setting the option “Keywords File Save On
Exit” to ‘always’.  Note that this doesn’t save the keywords when you
enter them, only when you close the database or quit Ebib.  You can also
set this option to ‘never’, which means Ebib will discard new keywords
when the database is closed.  Note that if you want to save the keywords
file without having to close the database, you can do so through the
menu.

   The option “Keywords Use Only File” controls whether Ebib uses only
the keyword file, or both the keyword file and the configured keyword
list.  This option is only useful when you have configured a keyword
file.  In that case, setting this option to use both the keyword list
and the keyword file tells Ebib to offer keywords from both sources when
you edit the keyword field.  Otherwise, only the keyword file is used.

   It is also possible to tell Ebib to sort the keywords in the
‘keywords’ field in alphabetical order.  Set the option “Keywords Field
Keep Sorted” if you want to do this.  Note that setting this option also
automatically removes duplicates.

   Lastly, you can configure the separator used between keywords in the
keyword field.  By default, it is set to ‘", "’, i.e., comma-space.
(The separator is a comma because that is what Biblatex expects in the
‘keywords’ field.)  If you change it, keep in mind that Ebib does not
add a space between keywords, so if you want a space, make sure to add
it to the separator.

23 Sorting the ‘.bib’ File
**************************

By default, the entries in the database are saved to the ‘.bib’ file in
alphabetical order according to entry key.  If you only deal with the
‘.bib’ file through Ebib, you may not care in which order the entries
are saved.  However, it may sometimes be desirable to be able to specify
the sort order of entries in more detail.  (Apparently, this can be
useful with ConTeXt, for example.)

   You can specify a sort order in Ebib’s customisation buffer.  To sort
the entries, you must set at least one sort level (that is, a field to
sort the entries on).  You can also specify more than one sort level: if
two entries have identical values for the first sort level, they will be
sorted on the second sort level.  E.g., if the first sort level is
‘author’ and the second is ‘year’, then the entries are sorted by
author, and those entries that have identical values for the ‘author’
field are sorted by year.

   A sort level is not restricted to a single field.  You can specify
more fields for a single sort level.  Within a single sort level, a
second sort field is used if the first sort field does not have a value.
For example, books that have an editor instead of an author will have an
empty ‘author’ field.  If you sort the database on the ‘author’ field,
such entries will all appear at the beginning of the ‘.bib’ file, which
is most likely not what you want.

   To remedy this, you can specify both the ‘author’ and the ‘editor’
fields for the first sort level.  Ebib will then sort an entry on its
‘author’ field if it has a value, and will otherwise use the value of
the ‘editor’ field.

   The difference between two sort fields within one sort level and two
sort levels is that a second sort _field_ is an alternative for the
first field when it has no value, while a second sort _level_ is an
additional sort criterion when two or more entries cannot be sorted on
the first level, because they have identical values.

   By default, the option ‘Sort Order’ has no value, which means that
the entries in the ‘.bib’ file are sorted according to entry key.  Those
that wish to customise the sort order will usually want to set the first
sort level to ‘author editor’, and the second to ‘year’.  In that way,
the entries in the ‘.bib’ file are sorted according to author/editor,
and entries with the same author/editor are sorted by year.

   Entries that cannot be sorted on some sort level, because the sort
fields are empty, are sorted on entry key.  (Keep in mind that if the
first sort level yields _no value_ for a specific entry, Ebib does _not_
use the second sort level to sort that entry.  It uses the entry key.
The second sort level is only used if the first yields _identical_
values for two or more entries.)

   Note that if you wish to make use of this option, you need to unset
the option “Save Xrefs First” (*note Cross-referencing:
#cross-referencing.).  It is pointless to set a sort order if
cross-referenced entries are saved first.  Since “Save Xrefs First” is
set by default, you need to unset if you set “Sort Order”.

24 Merging and Importing
************************

As described in the previous chapter, adding entries to a database can
be done manually with the key ‘a’.  There are other ways of adding
entries to a database, however.

   In the index buffer, the Ebib menu has an option to merge a second
‘.bib’ file into the current database.  Ebib reads the entries in this
file and adds them to the database.  Duplicate entries (that is, entries
with an entry key that already exists in the database) will normally not
be loaded.  Ebib logs a warning about each duplicate entry to its log
buffer and displays a warning after loading the ‘.bib’ file when this
happens.  However, if you’ve customised Ebib to automatically generate
keys, duplicate entries will be merged into the current database under a
unique key.

   Another way to add entries to a database is to import them from an
Emacs buffer.  If, for example, you find ready-formatted BibTeX entries
in a text file or on the internet, you can copy & paste them to any
Emacs buffer (e.g. the ‘*scratch*’ buffer), and then execute the command
‘M-x ebib-import’.  Ebib then goes through the buffer and loads all
BibTeX entries it finds into the current database (i.e. the database
that was active when you lowered Ebib).  If you call ‘ebib-import’ while
the region is active, Ebib only reads the BibTeX entries in the region.

   If a BibTeX entry in the buffer lack an entry key (which sometimes
happens with BibTeX entries found on the internet), Ebib will generate a
temporary key for it of the form ‘<new-keyXX>’, where ‘XX’ is a number.
You can change such keys by hitting ‘E’ in the index buffer.  They will
also automatically be replaced with a more sensible key when you edit
them.  See the option “Autogenerate Keys” for details.

25 Exporting Entries
********************

Sometimes it can be useful to copy entries from one database to another,
or to create a new ‘.bib’ file with several entries from an existing
database.  For this purpose, Ebib provides exporting facilities.  To
export an entry to a ‘.bib’ file, use the command ‘x’.  This command
operates on a single entry or on all marked entries.

   When you export one or more entries, Ebib will ask you for a filename
to export them to.  If you have already exported an entry before, Ebib
will present the filename you used as default, but you can of course
change it.  For obvious reasons, Ebib appends the entry to the file that
you enter if it already exists, it does not overwrite the file.  If this
is not what you want, delete the file first, as Ebib provides no way to
do this.

   If you have more than one database open in Ebib, it is also possible
to copy entries from one database to another.  To do this, use the ‘x’
command with a numeric prefix argument.  E.g., if the database you want
to export an entry to is the second database, type ‘M-2 x’ to export the
current entry to it.  The number of the database is given in the
modeline of the index buffer.  If the database you’re copying an entry
to already contains an entry with the same entry key, Ebib won’t copy
the entry, and issues an appropriate warning message.

   Apart from entries, it is also possible to export the ‘@preamble’ and
‘@string’ definitions.  The ‘@preamble’ definition is exported with the
command ‘X’ in the index buffer.  ‘@string’ definitions can be exported
in the strings buffer: ‘x’ in this buffer exports the current string,
while ‘X’ exports all ‘@string’ definitions in one go.  All these
commands function in the same way: when used without a prefix argument,
they ask for a filename, and then append the relevent data to that file.
With a numeric prefix argument, they copy the relevant data to the
corresponding open database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Multiple Identical Fields,  Next: Multiline Edit Buffers,  Prev: Exporting Entries,  Up: Top

26 Multiple Identical Fields
****************************

Under normal circumstances, a BibTeX entry only contains one occurrence
of each field.  If BibTeX notices that an entry contains more than one
occurrence of an required or optional field, it issues a warning.  Ebib
is somewhat less gracious, it simply takes the value of the last
occurrence without giving any warning.  (Note, by the way, that BibTeX
will use the value of the _first_ occurrence, not the last.)  When extra
fields appear more than once in an entry, BibTeX does not warn you,
since it ignores those fields anyway.  Here, too, Ebib’s standard
behaviour is to ignore all but the last value.

   However, some online reference management services “use” this feature
of BibTeX in that they put multiple ‘keywords’ fields in the BibTeX
entries that they produce.  If you were to import such an entry into
Ebib, you would lose all your keywords except the last one.  To remedy
this, you can tell Ebib that it should allow multiple occurrences of a
single field in a BibTeX entry.  You can do this by setting the
customisation option “Allow Identical Fields”.

   With this option set, Ebib collapses the multiple occurrences into a
single occurrence.  All the values of the different occurrences are
collected and stored in the single occurrence, separated by colons
(actually, the value of the option “Keywords Separator”).  That is, Ebib
does not retain the multiple occurrences, but it does retain the values.
So suppose you have an entry that contains the following ‘keywords’
fields:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep},
    keywords = {winter},
    keywords = {hibernation}
}

   If you load this entry into Ebib with the option “Allow Identical
Fields” set, you will get the following:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep, winter, hibernation}
}


File: ebib.info,  Node: Multiline Edit Buffers,  Next: The Options Menu,  Prev: Multiple Identical Fields,  Up: Top

27 Multiline Edit Buffers
*************************

As mentioned several times before, Ebib has a special multiline edit
buffer, which is used to edit field values that contain newlines
(so-called _multiline fields_), and also to edit the contents of the
‘@preamble’ command.  This section discusses the details of this buffer.

   Ebib enters multiline edit mode in one of three cases: when you edit
the ‘@preamble’ definition, when you hit ‘m’ in the entry buffer to edit
the current field as multiline, or when you hit ‘e’ on the ‘annote’
field, or on a field whose value already is multiline.

   The mode that is used in the multiline edit buffer is
user-configurable.  The default value is ‘text-mode’, but if you prefer
to use some other mode, you can specify this through the customisation
options.  (Personally, I use ‘markdown-mode’ in the multiline edit
buffer, so that I can use ‘Markdown’
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write annotations,
which provides an easy way to create headers, use bold and italic, etc.,
in plain text.)

   Three commands are relevant for interacting with Ebib when you’re in
the multiline edit buffer, which are bound to key sequences in the minor
mode ‘ebib-multiline-edit-mode’, which is activated automatically in the
multiline edit buffer.

   ‘ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save’, bound to ‘C-c | q’, leaves the
multiline edit buffer and stores the text in the database.  If you
invoke this command when you’ve deleted all contents of the buffer
(including the final newline!)  and you were editing a field value or
the ‘@preamble’, the field value or preamble is deleted.  (This is in
fact the _only_ way to delete the ‘@preamble’ definition.  Field values
on the other hand can also be deleted by hitting ‘x’ or ‘d’ on them in
the entry buffer.)  If you were editing a ‘@string’ value, Ebib will
just complain, because string definitions cannot be empty.

   ‘ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer’, bound to ‘C-c | c’, also leaves the
multiline edit buffer, but it does so without storing the text.  The
original value of the field, string or preamble will be retained.  If
the text was modified, Ebib will ask for a confirmation before leaving
the buffer.

   ‘ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer’, bound to ‘C-c | s’, can be used in
the multiline edit buffer to save the database.  This command first
stores the text in the database and then saves it.  Because Ebib does
not do an autosave of the current database, it is advisable to save the
database manually every now and then to prevent data loss in case of
crashes.  It would be annoying to have to leave the multiline edit
buffer every time you want to do this, so this command has been provided
to allow you to do this from within the buffer.

   Admittedly, the key combinations of the multiline edit buffer are
somewhat awkward.  The reason for this is that these commands are part
of a minor mode, which restricts the available keys to combinations of
‘C-c’ plus a non-alphanumeric character.  However, it is possible to
change the key commands, if you wish.  Ebib itself provides a method to
change the second key of these commands, *note Modifying Key Bindings:
#modifying-key-bindings.  You could change the ‘|’ to e.g., ‘c’ or
‘C-c’, if these do not conflict with any key commands in the major mode
used for the multiline edit buffer.

   Even more drastically, you could put something like the following in
your ‘~/.emacs’:

(eval-after-load 'ebib
  '(progn
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-c" 'ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-q" 'ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-s" 'ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer)))

   This sets up ‘C-c C-c’, ‘C-c C-q’ and ‘C-c C-s’ for use in the
multiline edit buffer.  Since such key combinations are restricted for
use with major modes, however, Ebib cannot set these up automatically,
but as an Emacs user, you are free to do as you like, of course.

28 The Options Menu
*******************

In the index buffer, Ebib’s menu has an Options submenu.  This menu
gives you quick access to Ebib’s customisation buffer, and it also
provides checkboxes for several settings that can be toggled on and off.
All of these settings have defaults that can be defined in the
customisation buffer.  Setting or unsetting them in the Options menu
only changes them for the duration of your Emacs session, it doesn’t
affect the default setting.

   The same is true for the printing options that are in the Print menu.
When set or unset in the menu, the default values specified in the
customisation buffer do not change.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Customisation,  Prev: The Options Menu,  Up: Top

29 Customisation
****************

Ebib can be customised through Emacs’ standard customisation interface.
The relevant customisation group is (obviously) called ‘ebib’, which has
five subgroups: ‘ebib-faces’, ‘ebib-filters’, ‘ebib-notes’, and
‘ebib-keywords’, whose functions should be obvious, and ‘ebib-windows’,
where options for Ebib’s window management can be set.  All options are
documented in the customisation buffers.  You can go to Ebib’s
customisation buffer with ‘M-x customize-group RET ebib RET’, or by
using the menu «Ebib | Options | Customize Ebib».

   Another way to customise Ebib is to use the initialisation file
‘~/.emacs.d/ebibrc’.  (Actually, the location and name of this file can
be customised as well.)  This file contains normal Lisp code and is the
best way to customise key bindings (as discussed in the next section),
but it can in fact be used to run any Lisp code.

* Modifying Key Bindings::

29.1 Modifying Key Bindings
===========================

If you would like to change Ebib’s standard key bindings, or if you
would like to bind a command that is only available through the menu to
a key, you can do so by adding the relevant key bindings to Emacs init
file (‘~.emacs.d/init.el’ by default).  The relevant key maps are
‘ebib-index-mode-map’, ‘ebib-entry-mode-map’, ‘ebib-strings-mode-map’
for the index, entry, and strings buffer, and ‘ebib-multiline-mode-map’,
which adds keys to finish writing multiline field values.

   In addition, ‘ebib-search-map’ is a transient key map that is
activated when ‘ebib-search’ is called, and ‘ebib-filters-map’,
‘ebib-keywords-map’ and ‘ebib-reading-list-map’ are key maps (set up
using ‘define-prefix-command’) that contain bindings for filters,
keywords and the reading list, respectively.  Finally, there is
‘ebib-log-mode-map’ which is active in Ebib’s log buffer.

   As an example, the default keybindings in‘ebib-multiline-mode-map’,
which are rather awkward to type, can be redefined as follows:

(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-c" 'ebib-quit-multiline-buffer-and-save)
(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-q" 'ebib-cancel-multiline-buffer)
(define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
            "\C-c\C-s" 'ebib-save-from-multiline-buffer)
