Ebib Manual
***********

Ebib is a program with which you can manage BibTeX database files
without having to edit the raw `.bib' files. It runs in GNU/Emacs,
version 23.1 or higher (lower versions are not supported).

   It should be noted that Ebib is _not_ a minor or major mode for
editing BibTeX files. It is a program in itself, which just happens to
make use of Emacs as a working environment, in the same way that for
example Gnus is.

   The advantage of having a BibTeX database manager inside Emacs is
that X is no longer required, as Emacs can run on the console, and also
that some integration with Emacs' TeX and LaTeX modes becomes possible.
For example, you can push a BibTeX key from Ebib to a LaTeX buffer, or,
vice versa, when you're in a LaTeX buffer, you can consult your BibTeX
database and insert a key from it into the document. Another advantage
of Ebib is that it is completely controlled by key commands: no
stressful mouse movements are required, as with most other (usually
X-based) BibTeX database managers.

1.1 Package manager
===================

The easiest way to install Ebib is to use Emacs' package manager. Ebib
is available as a package from the Melpa package archive
(http://melpa.milkbox.net/). If you add the Melpa archive to your
`package-archive' list, you can install Ebib from the package manager.
This will also install the Info file so you can access the Ebib manual
within Emacs.

   Note: the package manager (`package.el') is part of Emacs 24. Users
of Emacs 23 have to install it first. See the ELPA page on
emacswiki.org (http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) for discussion.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Manual installation,  Next: Installing the info file,  Prev: Package manager,  Up: Installation

1.2 Manual installation
=======================

You can also install Ebib manually by copying the file `ebib.el' to
somewhere in your load path and add the following line to Emacs' init
file `~/.emacs':

(autoload 'ebib "ebib" "Ebib, a BibTeX database manager." t)

   On a default installation, the load path probably only contains
system directories. If you want to run `ebib.el' from somewhere else
(e.g., directly from the source directory), you can add this directory
to your load path:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/ebib"))

   Note: if you do not know what your load path is set to, go to the
`*scratch*' buffer, type `load-path' on an empty line, put the cursor
right after it and type `C-j'. The value of `load-path' will then
appear in the buffer.

   Alternatively, you can load Ebib directly by putting the following
in `.emacs':

(load "/path/to/ebib")

   The difference between `load' and `autoload' is that the former
loads Ebib immediately and thus slows down Emacs' startup (a bit),
while the latter loads Ebib only when it is called (and thus slows down
Ebib's first time start up a bit).

   It is recommended to byte-compile the source, Ebib runs quite a lot
faster when it is byte-compiled. You can do this either within Emacs
with `M-x byte-compile-file' (recommended on OS X), or from your shell
by going into the directory where you put `ebib.el' and typing:

emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ebib.el

   This will create a file `ebib.elc', which Emacs will load instead of
`ebib.el'

1.3 Installing the info file
============================

If you install Ebib through the package manager, the Info file is
installed automatically as well. However, if you install Ebib manually,
or run it from the source directory, this is not the case. If you want
the Info file to be accessible from within Emacs, you need to put it in
a directory where Emacs can find it. One way to do this is to put
`ebib.info' in one of the standard info directories. Make sure to run
`install-info ebib.info dir', so that Emacs knows about the new info
file.

   Alternatively, you can leave `ebib.info' in Ebib's source directory
and add that dir to `Info-additional-directory-list'. It contains a
suitable `dir' file, so there's no need to run `install-info'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Starting Ebib,  Prev: Installing the info file,  Up: Installation

1.4 Starting Ebib
=================

Once Ebib has been installed and is loaded, you can start it with `M-x
ebib'. This command is also used to return to Ebib when you have put
the program in the background. You can bind this command to a key
sequence by putting something like the following in Emacs' init file:

(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'ebib)

   You can of course choose any key combination you like. (In Emacs,
key combinations of `C-c' `<letter>' are reserved for the user, so that
no package may set them.)

   You can also call Ebib from an Eshell command line. This in itself
is entirely unspectacular (in Eshell, you can invoke any Emacs
function), but the nice thing is that you can then provide a filename
to load. So, provided a file `references.bib' exists in
`~/Work/Papers/', the following command:

~/Work/Papers $ ebib references.bib

   starts Ebib and loads the file `references.bib'.

2 Basic Usage
*************

A BibTeX database is somewhat of a free-form database. A BibTeX entry
consists of a set of field-value pairs. Furthermore, each entry is
known by a unique key. The way that Ebib navigates this database is by
having two windows, one that contains a list of all the entry keys in
the database, and one that contains the fields and values of the
currently highlighted entry.

   When Ebib is started, the current windows in Emacs are hidden and
the Emacs frame is divided into two windows. The top one contains a
buffer that is called the _index buffer_, while the lower window
contains the _entry buffer_. When a database is loaded, the index
buffer holds a list of all the keys in the database. You can move
through these keys with the cursor keys. In the entry buffer, the
fields of the currently highlighted entry are shown, with their values.

   In this chapter, all basic functions of Ebib are described, so that
you can get startet with it. At times, reference will be made to later
chapters, where more specific functions are described.

   Ebib has a menu through which most functions can be accessed.
Especially some of the lesser used functions can only be accessed
through the menu (unless you assign key shortcuts to them, of course.)

File: ebib.info,  Node: Getting Started,  Next: Editing the Database,  Up: Basic Usage

2.1 Getting Started
===================

Ebib is started with the command `M-x ebib'. Entering this command
hides all the windows in the current Emacs frame and replaces them with
two windows: the top one contains the index buffer, the bottom one,
taking up the larger part of the screen, contains the entry buffer. The
index buffer is named `none', to indicate that no database has been
loaded. If you open a database, or start a new one, the index buffer
will carry its name.

   You can quit Ebib by typing `q'. You will be asked for confirmation,
and you will receive a warning if you happen to have an unsaved
database. The command `z' can also be used to leave Ebib. However,
unlike `q', which completely quits Ebib, `z' only lowers it, so that it
remains active in the background. The `.bib' files that you have opened
remain loaded, and you can return to them by typing `M-x ebib' again.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Opening a bib File,  Next: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

2.1.1 Opening a `.bib' File
---------------------------

Loading a `.bib' file into Ebib is done with the command `o'. Ebib
reads the file that you specify, and reports how many entries it found,
how many `@string' definitions it found, and whether a `@preamble' was
found. Note that when Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it only reads entry
types (e.g. `book, article, phdthesis' etc.) that it knows about.
Fields (e.g. `author, title, year' etc.) that Ebib does not know about,
are loaded (and saved) but not displayed, so they cannot be edited.
Therefore, you should make sure that all the entry types and fields
that your databases use are defined. A sensible set has been
predefined, so that anyone who's using standard BibTeX entry types
should have no problem loading an existing `.bib' file into Ebib. If,
however, you have custom entry types, or custom fields in your `.bib'
files, you should define them. This can be done by selecting "Options |
Modify Entry Types" from the Ebib menu. (See also the chapter on
customising Ebib, esp. *note Entry Types: #entry-types.)

   Every time Ebib reads a `.bib' file, it produces a few log messages.
These are written into a special buffer `*Ebib-log*'. If Ebib
encounters entry types in the `.bib' file that it doesn't know, it will
log a warning. If Ebib finds something that it believes to be
incorrect, an error will be logged. If any warnings or errors occur
while loading the `.bib' file, Ebib tells you so after loading the
file. To view the log file, press `l' in the index buffer.

   Note that if Ebib detects warnings or errors, it will simply skip
the offending entry and continue parsing the rest of the `.bib' file.
That means that entries in which an error occurs are not read, and if
you then save the file, they will not be saved. So keep an eye out for
error messages after loading a `.bib' file: if there is something that
Ebib cannot parse, you may lose entries. (Though Ebib will create a
backup before overwriting a file.)

2.1.2 Preloading `.bib' Files
-----------------------------

Chances are that you will be doing most of your work with one or a few
`.bib' files, and you may find yourself opening the same file or files
every time you start Ebib. If so, you can tell Ebib to always load
specific `.bib' files on startup. To do this, specify the files in
Ebib's customisation buffer, under the option *note Preload Bib Files:
#preload-bib-files.

   By default, `.bib' files are searched for in your home directory.
Since this is most likely not where you keep the files, you need to
specify either the file's full path or a relative path starting from
your home directory. Alternatively, you can customize the option *note
Preload Bib Search Dirs: #preload-bib-search-dirs. to specify one or
more directories in which Ebib should search the `.bib' files.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Navigating a bib File,  Next: Starting a New bib File,  Prev: Preloading bib Files,  Up: Getting Started

2.1.3 Navigating a `.bib' File
------------------------------

Once you've opened a `.bib' file, the keys of all the entries in the
file are shown in alphabetical order in the index buffer in the top
Ebib window. (In fact, it is possible to show more than just the entry
key in this buffer. See *note Index Display Fields:
#index-display-fields. on how to accomplish this.) The first entry is
highlighted, meaning it is the current entry. The fields it holds and
their values are shown in the entry buffer in the bottom Ebib window.
The first field is the type field, which tells you what kind of entry
you're dealing with (i.e. `book', `article', etc.).

   Below the type field, Ebib displays (up to) three sets of fields.
The first set are the so-called obligatory fields, the fields that
BibTeX requires to be filled. The second group are the optional fields,
which do not have to be filled but which BibTeX will normally add to
the bibliography if they do have a value. The third group are the
so-called additional fields. These fields are usually ignored by BibTeX
(note that BibTeX normally ignores _all_ fields it does not know),
although there are bibliography styles that treat some of these fields
as optional rather than as additional; (i.e., the `harvard' styles do
typeset the `url' field, if present.)

   The first two groups of fields are different for each entry type,
while the third group are common to all entry types. You can use the
additional fields, for example, to add personal comments to the works
in your database. Ebib by default defines the following additional
fields: `crossref', `url', `annote', `abstract', `keywords', `file' and
`timestamp'. If these are not sufficient for you, you need to customise
Ebib and add your own fields. (See *note Additional Fields:
#additional-fields, if you need to find out how to do that.)

   To move around in the index buffer, you can use the `up' and `down'
cursor keys, `C-p' and `C-n', or for those more used to mutt's key
bindings, `k' and `j'. Furthermore, `Space' and `PgDn' move a screenful
of entries down, while `b' and `PgUp' move in the other direction.
Lastly, `g' and `Home' move to the first entry, while `G' and `End'
move to the last one.

   Ebib is not restricted to opening just one `.bib' file at a time.
You can open more files by just typing `o' again and entering the
filename. Ebib numbers the databases: the number of each database is
shown in the mode line of the index buffer, directly before the
database name. The keys 1-9 provide a quick way of jumping from one
database to another. Note that the numbering is dynamic: if you have
three databases opened and then close the second, database 3 becomes
database 2.

   With the `left' and `right' cursor keys, you can move to the
previous or next database. These keys wrap, so if you hit the `left'
cursor key while the first database is active, you move to the last
database. If you are done with a database and want to close it, type
`c'. This closes the current database. It does not leave Ebib, and all
other databases you have open will remain so.

2.1.4 Starting a New `.bib' File
--------------------------------

If you want to start a new `.bib' file from scratch, you cannot just go
and enter entries. You first have to give the database a name. So, to
start a new database, type `o' first, and give the new file a name.
Once you have done this, you can start adding entries to the database.

2.2 Editing the Database
========================

Of course, being able to open and view `.bib' files is only half the
fun. One needs to be able to edit the files as well. Ebib's essential
editing facilities are discussed here.

* Menu:

* Adding and Deleting Entries::
* Editing Fields Values::
* Editing Multiline Values::
* Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Next: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.1 Adding and Deleting Entries
---------------------------------

To add an entry to a database, you type `a'. When you do this, Ebib
first asks you for an entry key, as every entry must be identified by a
unique key. Just type a name for the new entry (say `Jones1998'). Since
the entry key must be unique, Ebib will complain if you enter a key
that already exists.

   You can also have Ebib automatically generate entry keys: if you set
the customisation option *note Autogenerate Keys: #autogenerate-keys,
Ebib does not ask you for a key when you add a new entry. Instead, it
creates a temporary key (of the form `<new-entry>'). When you have
finished entering the field values for the new entry, Ebib
automatically replaces the temporary key with a key that is based on
the contents of the `author' (or `editor'), `year' and `title' fields.

   Note that if you should later decide that you want to change the key
of an entry, you can do so with the command `E'. So if you have an
entry with the key `Jones1998' and you want to add another entry by
Jones from 1998, you can call the new one `Jones1998b' and rename the
existing one to `Jones1998a'. Similarly, it is possible to let Ebib
recreate an autogenerated key by pressing `K'.

   Deleting an entry is done with `d'. Be careful with this: you will
be asked for confirmation, but once you've confirmed, the entry is
gone, and it is not possible to bring it back. There is no undo in
Ebib. (If you haven't saved the database yet, it is still possible to
retrieve the deleted entry from the `.bib' file, and otherwise it may
still be in the backup file that Ebib creates. See *note Saving a
Database: #saving-a-database.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Fields Values,  Next: Editing Multiline Values,  Prev: Adding and Deleting Entries,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.2 Editing Fields Values
---------------------------

Editing the field values for an entry is done in the lower of the two
Ebib buffers, the so-called entry buffer. You can move focus to the
entry buffer by typing the command `e' in the index buffer.

   You can move between fields with the same keys that you use to move
between entries in the index buffer: the cursor keys `up' and `down',
`C-p' and `C-n', or `j' and `k'. `Space' and `PgDn' move to the next
set of fields, while `PgUp' and `b' move to the previous set of fields.
`g' and `G', and `Home' and `End' also work as expected.

   Editing a field value can be done with `e'. (In fact, in the entry
buffer, `RET' is equivalent to `e'.) For most fields, Ebib simply asks
you for a string value in the minibuffer. (Here, `RET' confirms the
edit, while `C-g' cancels it.) Although BibTeX requires that field
values be surrounded by braces {} (or double quotes "", but Ebib does
not use those, even though it can of course handle them when they are
used in an existing `.bib' file) you do not need to type these. Ebib
adds them when it saves the `.bib' file.

   Some fields, however, are handled in a special way. The first of
these is the `type' field: if you edit this field, you must enter one
of the predefined entry types. Ebib won't allow you to enter anything
else. You can use tab-completion in this case. Similarly, if you edit
the `crossref' field, Ebib requires that you fill in a key from the
database. Here, too, you can use tab-completion. The fields `keywords'
and `file' are also treated differently, see *note Managing keywords:
#managing-keywords. and *note Viewing Files: #viewing-files,
respectively.

   Note that if you're adding a new entry, Ebib automatically puts you
in the entry buffer after you've typed the entry key: you don't have to
type `e' to move to the entry buffer. When creating a new entry, it is
best to set the `type' field first, because the `type' field determines
which other fields are available for an entry.

   Note also that after editing a field, Ebib (usually) puts you on the
next field. This is convenient if you're creating a new entry and need
to fill out several fields in a row.

   If you're done editing the fields of the entry, type `q' to move
focus back to the index buffer. (Note: keys may have different
functions in the index buffer and the entry buffer. `q' is a typical
example: in the entry buffer, it quits editing the entry and moves
focus back to the index buffer. In the index buffer, however, `q' quits
Ebib.)


File: ebib.info,  Node: Editing Multiline Values,  Next: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Editing Fields Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.3 Editing Multiline Values
------------------------------

Apart from the `type' and `crossref' field, there is another field that
Ebib handles in a special way when you edit its value. This is the
`annote' field. Most field values normally consist of a single line of
text. However, because the `annote' field is meant for creating
annotated bibliographies, it would not be very useful if you could only
write one line of text in this field. Therefore, when you edit the
`annote' field, Ebib puts you in the so-called _multiline edit buffer_.
This is essentially a text mode buffer that allows you to enter as much
text as you like. To store the text and leave the multiline edit
buffer, type `C-c | q'.

   If you want to leave the multiline edit buffer without saving the
text you have just typed, type `C-c | c'. This command cancels the edit
and leaves the multiline edit buffer. The text that is stored in the
field you were editing is not altered.

   Multiline values are not restricted to the `annote' field. Any field
can in fact hold a multiline value. (Except of course the `type' and
`crossref' fields.) To give a field a multiline value, use `l' instead
of `e'. You will again be put in the multiline edit buffer, where you
can edit the value. Note that you can use `l' even if a field already
has a single line value. Ebib will just make that the first line in the
multiline edit buffer.

   When a field has a multiline value, only the first line is shown in
the entry buffer, for space reasons. To indicate that the value is
multiline, a plus sign `+' is placed in front of the value.

   By the way, the `e' key is smart about the way an entry must be
edited. If you press `e' on a field that already has a multiline value,
regardless of the fact whether it is the `annote' field or not, Ebib
puts you in the multiline edit buffer. Therefore, you need `l' only if
you want to give a field a multiline value when it doesn't have one yet.

   For more details on working with the multiline edit buffer, see
*note The Multiline Edit Buffer: #the-multiline-edit-buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Copy Cut Paste Yank and Delete,  Prev: Editing Multiline Values,  Up: Editing the Database

2.2.4 Copy, Cut, Paste (Yank), and Delete
-----------------------------------------

A few more commands are available when you're in the entry buffer
editing field values. The commands `c', `x' and `y' implement a copy
and paste system: `c' copies the contents of the current field to the
kill ring, `x' kills the contents of the current field to the kill
ring, and `y' yanks (pastes) the most recently killed text in the kill
ring. You can type `y' repeatedly to get the same effect you get in
Emacs when you type `M-y' after an initial `C-y': every additional use
of `y' moves back in the kill ring.

   Lastly, there is the command `d', which deletes the contents of the
current field without storing the text in the kill ring. (It asks for
confirmation, though, just to make sure.)

   Note that `y' only works when the current field does not have a
value yet. This is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting a field
value. If you do want to yank text into a field that already has a
value, simply hit `d' first to delete the text.

2.3 Saving a Database
=====================

When you have undertaken any kind of editing action on a database, it
is marked as modified, which is indicated in the mode line for the
index buffer. A modified database can be saved by typing `s'. This
saves the database to the file it was loaded from without asking for
confirmation. (It is similar to `C-x C-s' in Emacs.) If you're saving a
file for the first time after loading it, Ebib creates a backup file.
(Ebib honours `backup-directory-alist' when saving backups. Note that
you can also disable backups altogether with the option *note Create
Backups: #create-backups.

   If you have multiple databases open, have made changes in more than
one of them, and want to save all of them without going through each
yourself, you can save all databases at once through the menu.

   The menu also provides a way to save the database to another name
(or use `M-x ebib-write-database'). This command is similar to `C-x
C-w' in Emacs, so that after using it, the new `.bib' file becomes
associated with the database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Searching,  Next: Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib,  Prev: Saving a Database,  Up: Basic Usage

2.4 Searching
=============

Ebib provides several search methods. First, if you are in the index
buffer, the normal Emacs incremental searches, `C-s' and `C-r',
function as expected. You can use them to search entry keys. Note that
once you've found the key you're searching, you must hit `RET' to quit
the search and again `RET' to make the entry you found active. Ebib
does not update the entry buffer during incremental search, as this
would be rather pointless: you're only interested in the entry you're
searching for, not in the entries you pass along the way.

   Of course, it is also possible to search the database itself. If you
type `/', Ebib asks you for a search term. This can be a regular
expression, to allow for flexibility in searching. After hitting `RET',
Ebib will start searching the database (starting from the current
entry, _not_ from the first entry!) and will display the entry with the
first occurrence of the search string that it finds. All the
occurrences of the search string in that entry are highlighted.

   Ebib searches all the fields of each entry. It is not possible with
`/' to specify the fields to search. Note that if the search term is
found in a field with a multiline value, Ebib will highlight the `+'
sign that it displays in front of the field value. Keep an eye out for
this when doing a search, because Ebib only shows the first line of
multiline values, and if the search term appears in another line, the
highlighted `+' is the only indication that the search term was found.
(Well, that and the fact that Ebib does _not_ say `Search string not
found', of course...)

   A search term may of course appear more than once in the database.
To search for the next occurrence, type `n'. This will continue
searching for the search string in the rest of the database. Again, the
first entry found to contain the search string is displayed. Note that
`n' does not wrap: if the end of the database is reached, Ebib stops
searching. To continue searching from the top, hit `g' and then `n'.

   The functions described here form Ebib's basic search functionality.
Ebib also has a much more powerful search mechanism in the form of
_filters_. These are described in *note Filters: #filters.)

2.5 Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib
============================================

Having a BibTeX database manager running inside Emacs has an additional
advantage: it makes it easy to consult your BibTeX databases from a
text buffer. By default, this functionality is set up for LaTeX, for
Orgmode (http://orgmode.org) and for Pandoc
(http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) Markdown.

   In any (text mode) buffer, you can call the command
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' to insert a citation. When you invoke this
command, Emacs prompts you for a key from the database(s) associated
with the current buffer, a citation command and any optional
argument(s) the command allows. You can use TAB-completion to enter a
citation key, and after hitting `RET', Emacs puts a citation at the
cursor position in the current buffer with the key you selected. This
citation includes the additional markup for the text mode in question.
That is, if you call `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' from a LaTeX buffer, Ebib
inserts `\<cite>{<key>}' into your buffer, substituting the citation
command you select for `<cite>' and the key for `<key>'.

   You can also do it the other way around: if you're in the index
buffer in Ebib, you can push an entry to a text buffer. To do this, use
the command `p'. Ebib will ask you for a buffer to push the entry to, a
citation command and also any optional arguments, and then inserts a
citation at the current cursor position in the buffer you've supplied.

   The citation command that `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and the command
key `p' ask for have to be defined before you can use them. How to do
this is explained below, see *note Defining Citation Commands:
#defining-citation-commands. For LaTeX, only the `\cite' command is set
up by default, so you may want to add some commands. In Orgmode files,
Ebib inserts a link of the form `[[ebib:Jones1992][Jones (1992)]]'.
(Actually, you'll need to provide the `Jones (1992)' yourself, when
Ebib asks for a description.) If you use this, you should add the
following line to your init file:

(org-add-link-type "ebib" 'ebib)

   This will allow Orgmode to recognise Ebib links and allow you to
jump to the BibTeX entry in Ebib using `C-c C-o' (`org-open-at-point',
the normal Orgmode command for following links). Note that such org
links aren't properly translated to LaTeX citation commands when you
export your org file. For that, you'll need to set up a different link
type for each citation command and provide functions for exporting them
to LaTeX. The orgmode documentation explains how this is done. (You
can, in fact, create similar functions for exporting to other formats.)

   If you use `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in Pandoc Markdown, you can
choose between three citation commands: `text', which inserts a
citation of the form `@Jones1992', `paren', which inserts a citation of
the form `[@Jones1992]' and `year', which inserts `[-@Jones1992]'.
Since these are the only types of citations that Pandoc Markdown knows,
you shouldn't need to change anything.

   Calling Ebib from a text mode buffer has another small advantage. If
point is on a BibTeX key when Ebib is called, it jumps to that entry in
your database. This allows you to quickly check a reference in your
text. Ebib will search the entry in the current database, or, if you're
calling Ebib from a LaTeX file and there is a `\bibliography' or
`\addbibresource' command in the file, in the databases in these
commands, if they are opened in Ebib. See *note Associating a Database
with a LaTeX File: #associating-a-database-with-a-latex-file. below for
details.

   There is one more command that can be useful for LaTeX users:
`ebib-create-bib-from-bbl' creates a `.bib' file from the `.bbl' file
associated with the LaTeX document in the current buffer. This makes it
easy to create a `.bib' file containing just the BibTeX entries that
are used in the document. Note, however, that this command does not add
cross-referenced entries to the newly created `.bib' file, nor does it
add `@string' definitions and the `@preamble'. So make sure to add
those after using `ebib-create-bib-from-bbl'. (Improving this
functionality is on the TODO-list.)

2.5.1 Key Bindings
------------------

Of course, the easiest way to use the commands discussed here is to
bind them to a key sequence. For example, the following binds `C-c b'
to `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' in AUCTeX's LaTeX mode:

(define-key 'LaTeX-mode-map "\C-cb" 'ebib-insert-bibtex-key)

   Note that commands of the form `C-c <letter>' are reserved for the
user, and should therefore not be set by any package. For this reasons,
Ebib does not set this command automatically.

   `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' recognises the major mode of the buffer it
is called from and uses this information to determine which kinds of
citations to insert. So you can bind the `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' to
the same key sequence in every text mode in which you use citations and
Ebib will do the right thing.

2.5.2 Defining Citation Commands
--------------------------------

As mentioned, you should probably set up some citation commands if you
use Ebib with LaTeX documents. The customisation option that allows you
to do this is *note Citation Commands: #citation-commands.

   Citation commands are defined for specific major modes. You can also
define commands for all modes under the heading `any'. (By default,
this option is used for LaTeX commands, since there is more than one
Emacs mode for (La)TeX). Each command consists of an identifier, which
you type when Ebib prompts you for a citation command, plus a format
string, which is used to create the actual citation command.

   The identifier should be a simple string which you can type easily
when Ebib asks you for a citation command (TAB completion is available,
though). The format string can contain a few directives, which are used
to add the citation key and any optional arguments. The following
directives are recognised:

`%K'
     the entry key to be inserted.

`%A'
     an argument, for which the user is prompted.

`%<...%>'
     optional material surrounding a `%A' directive.

`%(...%<sep>)'
     a so-called _repeater_, which contains material that can be
     repeated. If present, the repeater must contain the entry key
     directive `%K'.

`%D'
     a description, for which the user is prompted. Mainly for use in
     Orgmode.

   In the simplest case, the format string contains just a `%K'
directive: `\cite{%K}'. In this case, `%K' is replaced with the
citation key and the result inserted. Usually, however, citation
commands allow for optional arguments that are formatted as pre- or
postnotes to the citation. For example, using the `natbib' package, you
have citation commands available of the form:

\citet[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}

   In order to be able to insert such citations, the format string must
contain `%A' directives:

\citet[%A][%A]{%K}

   With such a format string, Ebib asks the user to provide text for
the two arguments and inserts it at the locations specified by the
directives. Of course, it is possible to leave the arguments empty (by
just hitting `RET'). With the format string above, this would yield the
following citation in the LaTeX buffer:

\citet[][]{Jones1992}

   The empty brackets are completely harmless, because LaTeX will
simply ignore the empty arguments. However, you may prefer for the
brackets not to appear if the arguments are empty. In that case, you
can wrap the brackets and the `%A' directives in a `%<...%>' pair:

\citet%<[%A]%>%<[%A]%>{%K}

   Now, if you leave the arguments empty, Ebib produces the following
citation:

\citet{Jones1992}

   Note however, that in this case there is in fact one problem
associated with this format string. If you fill out the first argument
but not the second, Ebib produces the wrong format string:

\citet[cf.]{Jones1992}

   If only one optional argument is provided, `natbib' assumes that it
is a postnote, while what you intended is actually a prenote.
Therefore, it is best not to make the second argument optional:

\citet%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}

   This way, the second pair of brackets is always inserted, regardless
of whether you provide a second argument or not.

   `Natbib' commands also accept multiple citation keys. When you call
`ebib-insert-bibtex-key' from within a LaTeX buffer, you can only
provide one key, but when you're in Ebib, you can mark multiple entry
keys and then use `; p' to push them to a buffer. In this case, Ebib
asks you for a separator and then inserts all keys into the position of
`%K':

\citet{Jones1992,Haddock2004}

   It is, however, also possible to specify in the format string that a
certain sequence can be repeated and how the different elements should
be separated. This is done by wrapping that portion of the format
string that can be repeated in a `%(...%)' pair. Normally, you'll want
to provide a separator, which is done by placing it between the `%' and
the closing parenthesis:

\citet[%A][%A]{%(%K%,)}

   This format string says that the directive `%K' can be repeated and
that multiple keys must be separated with a comma. The advantage of
this is that you are no longer asked to provide a separator.

   It is also possible to put `%A' directives in the repeating part.
This is useful for the `biblatex' package. `Biblatex' has so-called
_multicite_ commands, which take the following form:

\footcites[cf.][p. 50]{Jones1992}[][p. 201]{Haddock2004}

   Multicite commands can take more than one citation key in braces
`{}' and each of those citation keys can take two optional arguments in
brackets `[]'. In order to get such citations, you can provide the
following format string:

\footcites%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Here, the entire sequence of two optional arguments and the
obligatory citation key is wrapped in `%(...%)', so that Ebib knows it
can be repeated. If you now mark multiple entries in Ebib, press `; p'
and select the `footcites' command, Ebib will put all the keys in the
citation, asking you for two arguments for each citation key.

   Of course it is also possible to combine parts that are repeated
with parts that are not repeated. In fact, that already happens in the
previous example, because the part `\footcites' is not repeated. But
the part that is not repeated may contain `%A' directives as well:

\footcites%<(%A)%>(%A)%(%<[%A]%>[%A]{%K}%)

   Multicite commands in `biblatex' take two additional arguments
surrounded with parentheses. These are pre- and postnotes for the
entire sequence of citations. They can be accommodated as shown.

   Lastly, a citation command can also contain a `%D' directive. This
is mainly for use in Orgmode citations, which take the form
`[[ebib:<key>][<description>]]'. The description is not an argument to
the citation command but the string that will be displayed in the
Orgmode buffer.

2.5.3 Associating a Database with a LaTeX File
----------------------------------------------

The commands `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' and `ebib-entry-summary' must
consult the database or databases loaded in Ebib, and Ebib tries to be
smart about which database(s) to consult. Usually, a LaTeX file has a
`\bibliography' command somewhere toward the end, which names the
`.bib' file or files that contain the bibliography entries. If you
consult a BibTeX database from within a LaTeX file, Ebib first looks
for a `\bibliography' command, reads the names of the `.bib' file(s)
from it, and then sees if those files happen to be open. If they are,
Ebib uses them to let you pick an entry key (in the case of
`ebib-insert-entry-key') or to search for the entry (in the case of
`ebib-entry-summary').

   Of course, it may be the case that the LaTeX file is actually part
of a bigger project, and that only the master file contains a
`\bibliography' command. To accommodate for this, Ebib checks whether
the (buffer-local) variable `TeX-master' is set to a filename. If it
is, it reads that file and tries to find the `\bibliography' command
there. (Note: `TeX-master' is an AUCTeX variable, which is used to keep
track of multi-file projects. If you don't use AUCTeX, this
functionality doesn't work, and Ebib will only check the current file
for a `\bibliography' command.)

   Note that if one of the `.bib' files in the `\bibliography' command
isn't loaded, Ebib issues a warning message about this, and continues
to check for the next `.bib' file. These warning messages appear in the
minibuffer, but are probably directly overwritten again by further
messages or prompts Ebib produces, so check the `*Messages*' buffer if
Ebib doesn't seem to be able to find an entry that you're sure is in
one of your databases.

   Another thing to keep in mind is that Ebib only looks for a
`\bibliography' command once: the first time either
`ebib-insert-bibtex-entry' or `ebib-entry-summary' is called. It stores
the result of this search and uses it the next time either of these
commands is used. Therefore, if you make a change to the
`\bibliography' command, you must reload the file (use `M-x
revert-buffer' or `C-b C-v RET') to make sure Ebib rereads the
`\bibliography' command.

   If no `\bibliography' command is found at all, either in the LaTeX
file itself, or in the master file, Ebib simply consults the current
database, i.e. the database that was active when Ebib was lowered with
`z'. This is also what Ebib does for Orgmode or Pandoc Markdown files,
since they do not have the equivalent of a bibliography command.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Cross-referencing,  Next: Selecting Entries,  Prev: Consulting BibTeX Databases outside Ebib,  Up: Basic Usage

2.6 Cross-referencing
=====================

BibTeX has a cross-referencing facility. Suppose you have an entry
`Jones1998', which appeared in a book that is also in your database,
say under `Miller1998'. You can tell BibTeX that `Jones1998' is
contained in `Miller1998' by putting `Miller1998' in the `crossref'
field. When BibTeX finds such a cross-reference, all the fields of
`Jones1998' that don't have a value inherit their values from
`Miller1998'. At the very least, this saves you some typing, but more
importantly, if two or more entries cross-reference the same entry,
BibTeX automatically includes the cross-referenced entry in the
bibliography (and puts a reduced reference in the cross-referencing
entries).

   When you fill in the `crossref' field in Ebib, Ebib displays the
values of the cross-referenced entry in the entry buffer. To indicate
that they are just inherited values, they are marked with
`ebib-crossref-face', which by default is red. (You can customise it,
of course. See the customisation option *note Crossref Face:
#crossref-face.) These values are merely displayed for convenience:
they cannot be edited. (They can be copied, however).

   BibLaTeX has a more sophisticated cross-referencing mechanism. While
cross-referencing entries simply inherit the fields of the same name
from the cross-referenced entry in BibTeX, BibLaTeX has the option to
specify that, e.g., the `booktitle' field of the entry type
`incollection' inherits from the `title' field of the cross-referenced
entry. If you want Ebib to honour such inheritances, you can customise
the variable `ebib-biblatex-inheritances'. This variable allows you to
specify inheritance relations for individual entry types, or, by
specifying `all' as the entry type, for all entry types. (Note that the
former always override the latter.) Currently, this support for
BibLaTeX is still rudimentary. It will be improved in the future, but
for the moment it should help you get started if you use BibLaTeX.

   If you're viewing an entry that has a cross-reference and you want
to go to the cross-referenced entry you can type `C'. This command
reads the value of the `crossref' field and then displays that entry.
If you want to do the reverse, i.e., see if the current entry is
cross-referenced by any other entries, you can use the same key `C': if
you type `C' on an entry that does not have a cross-reference, Ebib
makes the key of the current entry the current search string and
searches for its first occurrence after the current entry. Note that
after Ebib has jumped to the first cross-referencing entry, you cannot
type `C' again to find the next one. (Instead, it would take you back
to the cross-referenced entry.) In order to find the next
cross-referencing entry, you have to type `n', as with a normal search.

   Note that if you want to use BibTeX's cross-referencing options, you
need to set the option *note Save Xrefs first: #save-xrefs-first. This
tells Ebib to save all entries with a `crossref' field first in the
`.bib' file. Without this, BibTeX's cross-referencing will not work
reliably.

2.7 Selecting Entries
=====================

Commands in the index buffer generally operate on one single entry, or
on all entries. For some commands, however, it may sometimes be useful
to perform them on more than one entry, but not necessarily all of
them. This can be achieved by selecting entries. You can select the
entries you want to perform a command on with the key `m'. This selects
(or unselects) the current entry. Selected entries are highlighted.
(Note that the face properties of selected entries can be customised
through the customisation option *note Selected Face: #selected-face.)

   Of the commands discussed so far, two can be used on selected
entries: `d' and `p'. Note, however, that it is not enough to select
the entries you want and then type any of these commands. If you do so,
they will behave as if no entries were selected. To get these commands
to work on the selected entries, you have to type a semicolon before
them. That is, `; d' deletes all selected entries, `; p' pushes all
selected entries to a LaTeX buffer. The command `m' itself can also be
used with the `;' prefix. If there are any selected entries, `; m'
unselects them all. Otherwise, `; m' selects all entries.

   When using `; p' to push all selected entries to a LaTeX buffer,
they are put in a single citation command, separated by commas. Ebib
does not create a citation command for each entry separately.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Printing the Database,  Next: Calling a Browser,  Prev: Selecting Entries,  Up: Basic Usage

2.8 Printing the Database
=========================

Sometimes it may be useful to have a `.pdf' file or print-out of your
database. Although Ebib does not actually do the printing itself, it
can create a LaTeX file for you that you can compile and print. In
fact, there are two ways of doing this.

   The print options are available in the Ebib menu when the index
buffer is active. You can print the entries as index cards or as a
bibliography.

   If you print your entries as a bibliography, Ebib creates a simple
LaTeX document that essentially contains a `\nocite{*}' command
followed by a `\bibliography' command referring to the `.bib' file
belonging to the current database. You can then run the usual sequence
of LaTeX, BibTeX, LaTeX, LaTeX on this file, creating a document
containing a list of all the references in your database.

   If you choose to print as index cards, Ebib also creates a LaTeX
file. However, instead of simply providing a `\nocite{*}' command, this
file contains a `tabular' environment for each entry in the database
listing all the fields of that entry and their values.

   The entries are separated by a `\bigskip', but if you set the option
`Print Newpage' in the customisation buffer (or in the Print menu), the
entries are separated by a `\newpage', so that every entry is on a
separate page. The latter option is useful when printing actual index
cards (though you'd probably have to change the page size with the
`geometry' package as well).

   By default, the index cards only show single-line field values. That
is, multiline values are normally excluded. If you want to include
multiline values in the print-out, you have to set the option `Print
Multiline' in the Options menu or in Ebib's customisation buffer. (See
*note The Customisation Buffer: #the-customisation-buffer.) With this
option set, Ebib includes all multiline values in the LaTeX file that
it creates. Note however that Ebib does not change anything about the
formatting of the text in a multiline value. So if you plan to make
(heavy) use of this option, make sure that the way you type your text
conforms to LaTeX's conventions (e.g. empty lines to mark paragraphs,
etc.) and doesn't contain any characters such as `&' that are illegal
in LaTeX. (Or, alternatively, use LaTeX code in your multiline fields.)

   As mentioned, when you "print" the database, Ebib really just
creates a LaTeX file. More precisely, it creates a temporary buffer and
writes the LaTeX code into it, and then saves the contents of that
buffer to a file. After it has done that, Ebib lowers itself and
instruct Emacs to open the file in a buffer, which will then be
properly set up as a LaTeX buffer. From there you can run LaTeX and
view the result.

   Before doing all this, Ebib asks you which file to write to. Be
careful with this: since this is supposed to be a temporary file, Ebib
simply assumes that if you provide a filename of an existing file, it
can overwrite that file without warning!

   A better way to tell Ebib which file to use is to set the option
`Print Tempfile' in Ebib's customisation buffer to some temporary file.
When this option is set, Ebib will always use this file to write to,
and will not ask you for a filename anymore.

   Note that both print options operate on all entries of the database.
If there are selected entries in the database, however, only those are
printed.

   There are two more customisation options for printing the database.
These are `Print Preamble' and `LaTeX Preamble'. With these options,
you can specify what Ebib should put in the preamble of the LaTeX files
it creates. Use this if you want to use specific packages (e.g.
`\usepackage{a4}' or `\usepackage{times})'. This is especially useful
for printing a bibliography, since by default, Ebib uses BibTeX's
standard bibliography style. With the option `LaTeX Preamble' you can
set your preferred bibliography style. Details are discussed in the
chapter on customisation, see *note The Customisation Buffer:
#the-customisation-buffer.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Calling a Browser,  Next: Viewing Files,  Prev: Printing the Database,  Up: Basic Usage

2.9 Calling a Browser
=====================

With more and more scientific literature becoming available on-line, it
becomes common to store URLs and DOIs in a BibTeX database. Sometimes
you may want to load such a URL or a DOI in your browser. Ebib provides
a convenient way for doing so.

   If you type `u' in the index buffer, Ebib takes the first URL stored
in the `url' field of the current entry and passes it to your browser.
Furthermore, in the entry buffer, you can use `u' on _any_ field. If
you happen to have more than one URL stored in the relevant field, and
you want to pass the second (or third, etc.) to the browser, Ebib will
ask you which one you want to open. Alternatively, you can use a prefix
argument. So typing `M-2 u' sends the second URL to your browser.

   It is not even necessary that the relevant field contains _only_
URLs. It may contain other text mixed with the URLs: Ebib simply
searches the URLs in the field and ignores the rest of the text. Ebib
considers every string of characters that starts with `http://' or
`https://' and that does not contain whitespace or any of the
characters `" ' ; <' or `>' as a URL. The semicolon is included here
even though it is actually a valid character in URLs. This is done for
consistency, because the semicolon (actually, semicolon+space) is the
standard separator for files and keywords and in this way, you can use
the same separator to distinguish multiple URLs in the `url' field. By
default Ebib also regards everything that is enclosed in a LaTeX
`\url{...}' command as a URL. So if you use `;' to separate URLs and
then happen to run into a URL that contains a semicolon, you can
enclose it in `\url{...}' and it will be recognised properly. You can,
of course, customise the regular expression that controls this
behaviour. See the option *note Url Regexp: #url-regexp. for details.

   Similarly, with the key `i' in the index buffer you can send a DOI
to a browser. The DOI must be stored in the `doi' field. Unlike URLs,
there can only be one DOI in this field. The whole contents of the
field is assumed to be the DOI and is sent to the browser. Ebib adds
the URL `http://dx.doi.org/' before sending the DOI to the browser, so
the `doi' field should contain just the DOI itself.

   Ebib uses the Emacs function `browse-url' to call the default
browser on the system. If you prefer to use another browser, however,
you can specify this with the option *note Browser Command:
#browser-command. You can also customise the field that Ebib takes URLs
from, with the option *note Standard Url Field: #standard-url-field.
The same can be done for the DOI field.

2.10 Viewing Files
==================

If you have electronic versions of the papers in your database stored
on your computer, or any other file associated with your entries (e.g.,
notes, if you store those in separate files) you can use Ebib to call
external viewers for these files or have them opened in Emacs. The
interface for this is similar to that for calling a browser: if you
press `f' in the index buffer, Ebib searches the `file' field for a
filename and when it finds one, calls an appropriate viewer. And just
as with `u', you can use `f' in the entry buffer as well, in which case
it can be used on any field, not just the `file' field. It is also
possible to have more than one filename in a field. In that case, Ebib
asks you which one you want to open. If you want to open the first one
you can just hit ENTER. Alternatively, you can provide a prefix
argument: `M-2 f' for the second file, etc.

   When you edit the `file' field, you should type one filename at a
time (TAB completion works). When you hit ENTER, Ebib adds the filename
to the `file' field, adding a separator if necessary, and then asks you
for the next file. If you don't want to add another, just hit ENTER.
The default separator is `"; "' (semicolon-space), but this can be
customised (see *note Filename Separator: #filename-separator. for
details).

   With the option *note File Search Dirs: #file-search-dirs, you can
tell Ebib in which directories it should search for files in the `file'
field. Ebib does not search directories recursively, but you can
specify a relative path in the `file' field. That is, if you put
something like `a/Abney1987.pdf' in the `file' field, Ebib searches for
the relevant file in a subdirectory `a/' of the directories listed in
the option File Search Dirs. As an extra service, Ebib also searches
for the base filename, i.e., `Abney1987' in this particular case. Note,
by the way, that the first directory in File Search Dirs is used as the
starting directory for filename completion when editing the `file'
field.

   Ebib can call different external programs depending on the file
extension of the relevant file. The option *note File Associations:
#file-associations. allows you to specify which programs to call for
which types of files. By default, `.pdf' and `.ps' files are handled,
by `xpdf' and `gv', respectively. You can specify further file types by
their extensions (do not include the dot). The program is searched for
in `PATH', but you can of course specify the full path to the program.
There is also the option to open files in Emacs. Use this if you have
separate text files for notes, or if you want to read pdf files in
Emacs with `doc-view-mode'.

File: ebib.info,  Node: Window Management,  Next: Creating Entry Stubs,  Up: Advanced Features

3.1 Window Management
=====================

By default, Ebib takes over the entire Emacs frame it is started in,
displaying the index window at the top and the entry window below it.
There are a few options to change this behaviour, however. They are all
part of the customisation group `ebib-windows', and allow you to
specify two alternative ways to deal with Ebib windows.

   The main layout option (see *note Layout: #layout.) can be set to
display only the index buffer on startup. In this case, Ebib does not
display the entry buffer when it is started. Instead, only the index
buffer is displayed, which can be navigated in the usual manner. The
entry buffer is only displayed when you edit an entry or add a new one.
When you've finished editing and move back to the index buffer, the
entry buffer is hidden again.

   The entry buffer is also displayed if you press `RET'. When you do
this, the index buffer remains selected, so you can use this to display
the fields of an entry without moving focus to the entry window. If you
navigate the index buffer, the entry buffer remains visible, updating
its contents as you move around.

   When the layout option is set to not display the entry buffer, the
key `z' does not hide the index window. Rather, it just selects
another, non-Ebib window. In order to hide the index window, you can
use `Z' (that is a capital `Z').

   A third option to deal with windows is to set the layout to a custom
width. In this case, Ebib takes up the right part of the frame,
displaying the index and entry buffers. The width of the Ebib windows
can then be set with the option *note Width: #width, which defaults to
80. The width can be specified as an absolute value (the number of
columns), but also as a value relative to the current window. In that
case, you must specify a value between 0 and 1. Here, too, the key `z'
switches to a non-Ebib window without hiding the Ebib windows. Use
capital `Z' to hide them. Note that if you specify a custom width, the
multiline edit buffer is not displayed in the same window as the entry
buffer. Rather, Ebib uses another, non-Ebib window to display it.

   If you set Ebib's layout to display only the index buffer on
startup, you can additionally set the option *note Popup Entry Window:
#popup-entry-window. Normally, Ebib will reuse an existing window to
display the entry buffer (and restore its original buffer when you
leave the entry buffer). With this option set, however, Ebib uses the
Emacs function `display-buffer-popup-window' to create a new window
(which is destroyed again when you leave the entry buffer).

   Further relevant options are *note Window Vertical Split:
#window-vertical-split, which displays the index buffer to the left of
the frame rather than at the top, and *note Index Window Size:
#index-window-size, which determines the size of the index window
(either its height or its width, depending on whether the index window
is displayed at the top or on the left of the frame.)

3.2 Creating Entry Stubs
========================

If you have a directory full of (pdf) files of articles that you want
to add to your database, Ebib can make the task a little bit easier by
creating entry stubs for all the files. You can do this with the
command `M-x ebib-add-file-entry'. This command asks you for a file or
a directory and creates an entry in the current database for that file
or each file in the directory. The entries only contain a file field
pointing to the file, all the other information still has to be filled
out by hand, but this way you can at least keep track of which files
are already in your database.

   Note that the entry keys for the stubs are temporary keys. They will
be replaced by more permanent keys automatically when you edit the
entries. This behaviour is controlled by the function
`bibtex-generate-autokey', which has a number of customisation options.
Check out its doc string for details. If you prefer to edit the keys by
hand, you can do so in the index buffer by pressing `E'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @Preamble Definition,  Next: @String Definitions,  Prev: Creating Entry Stubs,  Up: Advanced Features

3.3 @Preamble Definition
========================

Apart from database entries, BibTeX allows three more types of elements
to appear in a `.bib' file. These are `@comment', `@preamble' and
`@string' definitions. Ebib provides facilities to handle the latter
two. `@comment' definitions cannot be added to a `.bib' file through
Ebib, and if Ebib finds one in a `.bib' file, it is simply ignored (and
dropped from the file when you save it).

   `@preamble' and `@string' definitions can be handled, however. Ebib
allows you to add one `@preamble' definition to the database. In
principle, BibTeX allows more than one such definition, but really one
suffices, because you can use the concatenation character `#' to
include multiple TeX or LaTeX commands. So, rather than having two
`@preamble' definitions such as:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " }
@preamble{ "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   you can write this in your `.bib' file:

@preamble{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} "
         # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} " }

   Creating or editing a `@preamble' definition in Ebib is done by
hitting `P' (uppercase `P') in the index buffer. Ebib uses the
multiline edit buffer for editing the text of the `@preamble'
definition, which means that as discussed above, `C-c | q' stores the
`@preamble' text and returns focus to the index buffer, while `C-c | c'
returns focus to the index buffer while abandoning any changes you may
have made. (For details on using the multiline edit buffer, see *note
The Multiline Edit Buffer: #the-multiline-edit-buffer.)

   In order to create a `@preamble' as shown above in Ebib, you only
have to type the text between the braces. Ebib takes care of including
the braces of the `@preamble' command, but otherwise it saves the text
exactly as you enter it. So in order to get the preamble above, you'd
have to type the following in Ebib:

"\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{} " # "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} "

   Note that when Ebib loads a `.bib' file that contains more than one
`@preamble' definition, it concatenates all the strings in them in the
manner just described and saves them in one `@preamble' definition.


File: ebib.info,  Node: @String Definitions,  Next: Managing Keywords,  Prev: @Preamble Definition,  Up: Advanced Features

3.4 @String Definitions
=======================

If you press `S' (that's a uppercase `S') in the index buffer, Ebib
hides the entry buffer in the lower window and replaces it with the
_strings buffer_. In this buffer, you can add, delete and edit
`@string' definitions.

   Adding a `@string' definition is done with the command `a'. This
will first ask you for an abbreviation and then for the value to be
associated with that abbreviation. Once you've entered these, Ebib will
sort the new abbreviation into the buffer.

   Moving between the `@string' definitions can be done in the usual
way: the cursor keys `up' and `down', `C-p' and `C-n' and `k' and `j'
move up and down. `Space' and `PgDn' move ten strings down, while `b'
and `PgUp' move in the other direction. The keys `g', `G', `Home' and
`End' also function as expected.

   To delete a `@string' definition, use `d'. To edit the value of a
definition, use `e'. There is also a command `c', which copies the
value of the current `@string' definition to the kill ring. Unlike in
the entry buffer, there are no corresponing commands `y' and `x'. (In
fact, `x' does exist, but has another function.) Yanking from the kill
ring can be done with `C-y/M-y' in the minibuffer when you edit a
`@string''s value. Cutting a `@string''s value is pointless, because a
`@string' definition must have a value.

   Having defined `@string' definitions, there must of course be a way
to use them. Just giving a field a string abbreviation as value will
not do, because Ebib puts braces around the value that you enter when
it writes the `.bib' file, so that BibTeX will not recognise the
abbreviation, and will not expand it. BibTeX will only recognise an
abbreviation if it appears in the `.bib' file outside of any braces.

   To accomplish this, you must mark a field's value as _raw_. A raw
field is a field whose value is not surrounded by braces when the
database is saved, so that BibTeX recognises it as an abbreviation. To
mark a field raw, press `r'. An asterisk will appear before the field,
indicating that it is raw. Pressing `r' again will change the field
back to normal. If you press `r' on a field that does not have a value
yet, Ebib will ask you for one.

   Note that this also makes it possible to enter field values that are
composed of concatenations of strings and abbreviations. The BibTeX
documentation for example explains that if you have defined:

@string{WGA = "World Gnus Almanac"}

   you can create a BibTeX field like this:

title = 1966 # WGA

   which will produce "1966 World Gnus Almanac". Or you can do:

month = "1~" # jan

   which will produce someting like "1 January", assuming your
bibliography style has defined the abbreviation `jan'. All this is
possible with Ebib, simply by entering the exact text including quotes
or braces around the strings, and marking the relevant field as raw.

   An easy way to enter a `@string' abbreviation as a field value is to
use the key `s' instead of `e'. If you type `s', Ebib asks you for a
`@string' abbreviation to put in the current field, and automatically
marks the field as raw. With this command, Ebib only accepts `@string'
definitions that are in the database, so that by using `s' you can make
sure you don't make any typos. Note that you can use tab completion to
complete a partial string.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Managing Keywords,  Next: Sorting the bib File,  Prev: @String Definitions,  Up: Advanced Features

3.5 Managing Keywords
=====================

Ebib provides a few special options for handling keywords. By default,
there is a `keyword' field in the list of additional fields. Editing
this field is a bit different from other fields. Instead of just
entering a string and hitting ENTER to store it and return to the entry
buffer, you should enter a single keyword and hit enter. The keyword
will then be added to the keywords already present and you are asked to
enter the next keyword. If you've added all keywords you want, just hit
ENTER to finish.

   The advantage of doing it this way is that you can reuse keywords:
once you've added a keyword to one entry, Ebib remembers it. The next
time you want to use the same keyword for a different entry, you just
need to type the first (few) letters, hit TAB and the keyword will be
completed. That makes it easier to ensure you use the exact same
keywords in different entries.

   Note that Ebib's keyword functionality is not used to check the
contents of keyword fields. It is simply a way to make it easier to
stick to specific keywords, which should make it easier to categorise
and search your entries. It is still possible to edit the `keyword'
field directly. To do so, use a prefix argument: `C-u e' (or any other
prefix argument) on the `keyword' field will allow you to edit the
entire contents in the normal way. Use this method if you want to
remove single keywords. (Blanking the entire `keyword' field is quicker
with `x' or `d'.)

   Remembering keywords is practical, but it is even more useful if
remembered keywords can be saved, so that they are available the next
time you start Ebib. There are two ways of doing this: first, there is
an option `ebib-keywords-list' that you can use to store keywords. (See
*note Keywords List: #keywords-list.) Keywords stored in this option
will be available for TAB completion to all databases in Ebib. New
keywords, however, will not automatically be stored. If you find you
need a keyword not on the list and want to make it permanent, you'll
have to add it to `ebib-keywords-list' yourself.

   The other way of making keywords permanent is by storing them in a
file. Ebib offers two ways of doing this (which are mutually exclusive,
so you have to choose one). You can either configure a single keyword
file, with keywords that are available to all databases, or you can
configure per-directory keyword files, with keywords that are available
for all `.bib' files in the same directory. You can set up keyword
files by configuring the option *note Keywords File: #keywords-file.
You can either set it to use a single keyword file, in which case you
need to specify a file with its full path, or you can use per-directory
keyword files, in which case you must provide a filename without a
path. That is, if you use per-directory keyword files, the files have
the same name in each directory. The default name is
`ebib-keywords.txt', but you can change that if you like, of course.

   Keyword files have a very simple format: they are text files with
one keyword per line. So you can easily create or edit keyword files by
hand, or have them autogenerated by some other programme. Keep in mind,
though, that Ebib does not check for changes to keyword files. If you
have a single keyword file, it is loaded when Ebib starts up;
per-directory keyword files are loaded when the first `.bib' file in
that directory is opened. If you open a second `.bib' file from the
same directory, Ebib won't reload the keywords file.

   When you close a database, Ebib checks if you have added new
keywords to it and asks you if you want to save them. You can tell Ebib
to save new keywords automatically by setting the option *note Keywords
File Save On Exit: #keywords-file-save-on-exit. to `always'. Note that
this doesn't save the keywords when you enter them, only when you close
the database or quit Ebib. You can also set this option to `never',
which means Ebib will discard new keywords when the database is closed.
Note that there are also two menu options for saving keywords.

   The option *note Keywords Use Only File: #keywords-use-only-file.
controls whether Ebib uses only the keyword file, or both the keyword
file and the configured keyword list. This option is only useful when
you have configured a keyword file. In that case, setting this option
to use both the keyword list and the keyword file tells Ebib to offer
keywords from both sources when you edit the keyword field. Otherwise,
only the keyword file is used.

   It is also possible to tell Ebib to sort the keywords in the
`keywords' field in alphabetical order. Set the option *note Keywords
Field Keep Sorted: #keywords-field-keep-sorted. if you want to do this.
Note that setting this option also automatically removes duplicates.

   Lastly, you can configure the separator used between keywords in the
keyword field. By default, it is set to `"; "', i.e., semicolon plus
space. If you change it, keep in mind that Ebib does not add a space
between keywords, so if you want a space, make sure to add it to the
separator.

3.6 Sorting the `.bib' File
===========================

By default, the entries in the database are saved to the `.bib' file in
alphabetical order according to entry key. If you only deal with the
`.bib' file through Ebib, you may not care in which order the entries
are saved. However, it may sometimes be desirable to be able to specify
the sort order of entries in more detail. (Apparently, this can be
useful with ConTeXt, for example.)

   You can specify a sort order in Ebib's customisation buffer. To sort
the entries, you must set at least one sort level (that is, a field to
sort the entries on). You can also specify more than one sort level: if
two entries have identical values for the first sort level, they will
be sorted on the second sort level. E.g., if the first sort level is
`author' and the second is `year', then the entries are sorted by
author, and those entries that have identical values for the `author'
field are sorted by year.

   A sort level is not restricted to a single field. You can specify
more fields for a single sort level. Within a single sort level, a
second sort field is used if the first sort field does not have a
value. For example, books that have an editor instead of an author will
have an empty `author' field. If you sort the database on the `author'
field, such entries will all appear at the beginning of the `.bib'
file, which is most likely not what you want.

   To remedy this, you can specify both the `author' and the `editor'
fields for the first sort level. Ebib will then sort an entry on its
`author' field if it has a value, and will otherwise use the value of
the `editor' field.

   The difference between two sort fields within one sort level and two
sort levels is that a second sort _field_ is an alternative for the
first field when it has no value, while a second sort _level_ is an
additional sort criterion when two or more entries cannot be sorted on
the first level, because they have identical values.

   By default, the option `Sort Order' has no value, which means that
the entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to entry key. Those
that wish to customise the sort order will usually want to set the
first sort level to `author editor', and the second to `year'. In that
way, the entries in the `.bib' file are sorted according to
author/editor, and entries with the same author/editor are sorted by
year.

   Entries that cannot be sorted on some sort level, because the sort
fields are empty, are sorted on entry key. (Keep in mind that if the
first sort level yields _no value_ for a specific entry, Ebib does
_not_ use the second sort level to sort that entry. It uses the entry
key. The second sort level is only used if the first yields _identical_
values for two or more entries.)

   Note that if you have set the option `Save Xrefs First' (see *note
Cross-referencing: #cross-referencing.), it is pointless to set a sort
order. Saving cross-referencing entries first messes up any sort order,
so Ebib simply ignores the sort order if `Save Xrefs First' is set.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Merging and Importing,  Next: Exporting Entries,  Prev: Sorting the bib File,  Up: Advanced Features

3.7 Merging and Importing
=========================

As described in the previous chapter, adding entries to a database can
be done manually with the key `a'. There are other ways of adding
entries to a database, however.

   In the index buffer, the Ebib menu has an option to merge a second
.bib file into the current database. Ebib reads the entries in this
file and adds them to the database. Duplicate entries (that is, entries
with an entry key that already exists in the database) will not be
loaded. Ebib logs a warning about each duplicate entry to its log
buffer and displays a warning after loading the `.bib' file when this
happens.

   Another way to add entries to a database is to import them from an
Emacs buffer. If, for example, you find ready-formatted BibTeX entries
in a text file or on the internet, you can copy & paste them to any
Emacs buffer (e.g. the `*scratch*' buffer), and then execute the
command `M-x ebib-import'. Ebib then goes through the buffer and loads
all BibTeX entries it finds into the current database (i.e. the
database that was active when you lowered Ebib). If you call
`ebib-import' while the region is active, Ebib only reads the BibTeX
entries in the region.

   If the BibTeX entries in the buffer lack an entry key (which
sometimes happens with BibTeX entries found on the internet), Ebib will
generate a temporary key for it of the form `<new-keyXX>', where `XX'
is a number. You can change such keys by hitting `E' in the index
buffer. They will also automatically be replaced with a more sensible
key when you edit them. See *note Autogenerate Keys:
#autogenerate-keys. for details.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Exporting Entries,  Next: Timestamps,  Prev: Merging and Importing,  Up: Advanced Features

3.8 Exporting Entries
=====================

Sometimes it can be useful to copy entries from one database to
another, or to create a new `.bib' file with several entries from an
existing database. For this purpose, Ebib provides exporting
facilities. To export an entry to a `.bib' file, use the command `x'.
Ebib will ask you for a filename to export the entry to. (If you have
already exported an entry before, Ebib will present the filename you
used as default, but you can of course change it.)

   For obvious reasons, Ebib appends the entry to the file that you
enter if it already exists, it does not overwrite the file. If this is
not what you want, delete the file first, as Ebib provides no way to do
this.

   If you have more than one database open in Ebib, it is also possible
to copy entries from one database to another. To do this, use the `x'
command with a numeric prefix argument. E.g., if the database you want
to export an entry to is the second database, type `M-2 x' to export
the current entry to it. The number of the database is given in the
modeline of the index buffer.

   If the database you're copying an entry to already contains an entry
with the same entry key, Ebib won't copy the entry, and issues an
appropriate warning message.

   Note that the command `x' can operate on selected entries. So to
export several entries in one go select them and type `; x'. You can
use a prefix argument in the normal way: `M-2 ; x' exports the selected
entries to database 2.

   Apart from entries, it is also possible to export the `@preamble'
and `@string' definitions. The `@preamble' definition is exported with
the command `X' in the index buffer. `@string' definitions can be
exported in the strings buffer: `x' in this buffer exports the current
string, while `X' exports all `@string' definitions in one go. All
these commands function in the same way: when used without a prefix
argument, they ask for a filename, and then append the relevent data to
that file. With a numeric prefix argument, they copy the relevant data
to the corresponding open database.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Multiple Identical Fields,  Prev: Exporting Entries,  Up: Advanced Features

3.9 Timestamps
==============

Ebib provides the possibility to add a timestamp to every new entry,
recording the time it was added to the database. The timestamp is
recorded in the (additional) field `timestamp'. (By default, this field
is not shown, but you can make it visible by checking the option "Show
Hidden Fields" in the Options menu.)

   You can tell Ebib to create timestamps by setting the option `Use
Timestamp' in Ebib's customisation buffer. With this option set, a
timestamp is included in entries added to the database with `a'. Ebib
will also add a timestamp to entries imported from a buffer or merged
from a file, and to entries exported to another database or to a file.
When importing or exporting entries, existing timestamps will be
overwritten. The logic behind this is that the timestamp records the
date and time when the entry was added to the database, not when it was
first created.

   Note that if this option is unset, the timestamp of an entry is
retained when it's imported or exported. Therefore, if you record
timestamps and want to im-/export entries without changing their
timestamps, temporarily unset this option.

   Ebib uses the function `format-time-string' to create the timestamp.
The format string that Ebib uses can be customised in Ebib's
customisation buffer. The default string is `"%a %b' `%e %T %Y"', which
produces a timestamp of the form `"Mon Mar 12 01:03:26 2007"'.
Obviously, this string is not suited for sorting, so if you want to be
able to sort on timestamps, you'll need to customise the format string.
See the documentation for `format-time-string' on the options that are
available.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Multiple Identical Fields,  Next: Filters,  Prev: Timestamps,  Up: Advanced Features

3.10 Multiple Identical Fields
==============================

Under normal circumstances, a BibTeX entry only contains one occurrence
of each field. If BibTeX notices that an entry contains more than one
occurrence of an obligatory or optional field, it issues a warning.
Ebib is somewhat less gracious, it simply takes the value of the last
occurrence without giving any warning. (Note, by the way, that BibTeX
will use the value of the _first_ occurrence, not the last.) When
additional fields appear more than once in an entry, BibTeX does not
warn you, since it ignores those fields anyway. Here, too, Ebib's
standard behaviour is to ignore all but the last value.

   However, some online reference management services "use" this
feature of BibTeX in that they put multiple `keywords' fields in the
BibTeX entries that they produce. If you were to import such an entry
into Ebib, you would lose all your keywords except the last one. To
remedy this, you can tell Ebib that it should allow multiple
occurrences of a single field in a BibTeX entry. You can do this by
setting the customisation option *note Allow Identical Fields:
#allow-identical-fields.

   With this option set, Ebib collapses the multiple occurrences into a
single occurrence. All the values of the different occurrences are
collected and stored in the single occurrence, separated by semicolons.
That is, Ebib does not retain the multiple occurrences, but it does
retain the values. So suppose you have an entry that contains the
following `keywords' fields:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep},
    keywords = {winter},
    keywords = {hibernation}
}

   If you load this entry into Ebib with the option `Allow Identical
Fields' set, you will get the following:

@book{Jones1998,
    author = {Jones, Joan},
    year = {1998},
    ...
    keywords = {sleep; winter; hibernation}
}

3.11 Filters
============

As discussed, Ebib has a straightforward search functionality that can
be invoked with `/'. There is, however, also a much more sophisticated
search mechanism that makes use of _filters_.

   A filter is basically a search expression that selects entries from
the current database. When you apply a filter to a database, only the
entries that match are shown. With filters, you can, for example,
select all entries from a database that contain the string "Jones" in
their `author' field. A filter can be as complex as you want: you can
select all entries that do _not_ contain "Jones" in the `author' field,
or all entries that contain "Jones" in either the `author' or the
`editor' field, or all entries that contain "Jones" in the `author'
field, and "symbiotic hibernation" in the `keyword' field, etc.
Basically, the filter can consist of an arbitary number of search
criteria combined with the logical operators `and, or' and `not'.

* Properties of Filtered Databases::


File: ebib.info,  Node: Simple Selection,  Next: Complex Filters,  Up: Filters

3.11.1 Simple Selection
-----------------------

Creating a filter is simple: press `&', and Ebib will ask you for a
field to select on, and for a regular expression to select with. So if
you want to select all entries that contain "Jones" in the `author'
field, you press `&' and type `author' as the field and `Jones' as the
regexp to filter on. Ebib then runs this filter on the database, and
only shows those entries that match the filter. To indicate that a
filter is active, the active filter is displayed in a header line at
the top of the index buffer. (The filter can be displayed in Lisp form,
if you prefer: customise *note Filters Display As Lisp:
#filters-display-as-lisp. to do so.)

   If you don't want to filter on one specific field but rather want to
select all entries that match a certain regexp in any field, you can
type `any' as the field to filter on. So specifying `any' as the field
and `Jones' as the regexp will give you all entries that have a field
that contains "Jones" in them.

   Note that you can also select items based on their entry type. In
order to do that, you need to specify `=type=' as the field to search,
which is the field name in which Ebib stores the entry type internally.
Note that there is also a "normal" field called `type', hence the equal
signs. If you search the `=type=' field, only exact matches are
returned, so if you search for `book', only the entries that are of
type `book' are returned, not those of type `inbook'. You can use TAB
completion in this case, by the way.

   If you specify the `keywords' field, the keywords associated with
your database are available for TAB completion as well. Though you can
enter any search term, of course.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Complex Filters,  Next: Storing and Saving Filters,  Prev: Simple Selection,  Up: Filters

3.11.2 Complex Filters
----------------------

Once you have a filter on your database, you can refine or extend it.
For example, suppose you have a filter selecting all entries with
"Jones" in the `author' field and want to add all entries that have
"Jones" in the editor field to your selection. I this case you need to
do a logical `or' operation: you want to select an entry if it contains
"Jones" in the `author' field (which you already did) _or_ if it
contains "Jones" in the `editor' field.

   A short sidenote: the first impulse in a case like this might be to
use `and' instead of `or': after all, you want to select all entries
that contain "Jones" in the `author' field _and_ all entries that
contain "Jones" in the `editor' field. However, the filter that you
build up is used to test each entry _individually_ whether it meets the
selection criterion. An entry meets the criterion if it contains
"Jones" in the `author' field _or_ if it contains "Jones" in the
`editor' field. Therefore, `or' is the required operator in this case.
If you would use `and', you would only get those entries that contain
"Jones" in both the `author' _and_ `editor' fields.

   To perform a logical `or' operation, press the key `|'. As before,
you will be asked which field you want to filter on, and which regexp
you want to filter with. Ebib will then update the index buffer.

   It is also possible to perform a logical `and' on the filter. Use
this if you want to select those entries that contain "Jones" in the
`author' field and e.g. "symbiotic hibernation" in the `keyword' field.
A logical `and' operation is done with the key `&'. (Note: this is the
same key that is used to create the filter. In fact, you can create a
filter with `|' as well: when used in an unfiltered database, `&' and
`|' are equivalent. They are only different when a filter is already
active.)

   Both the `&' and `|' commands can be used with the negative prefix
argument `M--' (or `C-u -', which is identical). In this case, the
search criterion is negated. That is, the negative prefix argument
performs a logical `not' operation on the search criterion. For
example, if you want to select all entries from a database that do
_not_ contain "Jones" in the `author' field, you can do this by typing
`M-- &' and then filling out the relevant field and regexp.

   There is another way of performing a logical `not' operation, which
is only available when a filter is active: by pressing the key `~', you
invert the current filter. That is, if you have a filtered database
with all the entries containing "Jones" in the `author' or in the
`editor' field, and you press `~', the selection is inverted, and now
contains all entries that do _not_ have "Jones" in the `author' or
`editor' field.

   Although `~' and the negative prefix argument to `&' or `|' both
perform logical `not' operations, they are _not_ equivalent: `~'
negates the entire filter built up so far, while the negative prefix
argument only negates the single selection criterion you enter with it.

   When a filter is active, the filter itself is displayed at the top
of the index buffer. If the index window is too small to display the
entire filter (which can easily happen if Ebib is set to split the
frame vertically rather than horizontally), you can press `F v'
(capital `F', small `v'), which will display the filter in the
minibuffer.

   To cancel the filter and return to the normal view of the database,
press `F c'. For convenience, this action is also available with `c',
which normally closes a database. If a filter is active, however, it
simply cancels the filter. (If you find this behaviour confusing, you
can rebind the `c' key to the function `ebib-close-database'. See *note
Modifying Key Bindings: #modifying-key-bindings. for details.)

3.11.3 Storing and Saving Filters
---------------------------------

When you cancel a filter, it is automatically stored so that it can be
reapplied later. To reapply a filter, type `F L'. This will reapply the
last used filter regardless of which database you're in. That is, you
can use this to search more than one database without having to type
the filter over and over.

   However, Ebib only stores one filter this way. If you want to store
more filters, you have to name them. You can store the currently active
filter or the last used filter with `F s'. Ebib will ask you for a name
for the filter in order to identify it later. By default, filter names
are case-insensitive, but if you prefer to use case-sensitive filter
names, you can unset the option *note Filters Ignore Case:
#filters-ignore-case. When Ebib is closed, all stored filters are saved
to a file and they're automatically reloaded when you open Ebib again.
Stored filters are not associated with a particular database: once a
filter is stored, it is available to all databases.

   You can apply a stored filter with `F a'. This will ask for the name
of a filter and apply it to the current database. You can extend the
filter in the normal way, though the changes will not be stored
automatically. To store it, type `F s' again. You can store the
extended filter under the old name, in which case Ebib will ask you for
confirmation, or under a new name, which will store it as a new filter,
keeping the old one.

   The file that Ebib uses to store filters is
`~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters', although that can of course be customised
(see *note Filters Default File: #filters-default-file.). As mentioned,
stored filters are saved automatically when Ebib closes, but you can
also save them manually with `F S'. Note that if there are no stored
filters when Ebib is closed (or when you press `F S'), the file is
deleted.

   You can also save your filters to a different file with `F w'. Such
a filter file can be reloaded later with `F l'. If you load filters
from a file while you still have stored filters, you are asked if you
want to replace them completely or if you want to add the new filters
to the existing ones. In the latter case, however, filters whose name
conflict with existing filters are not loaded. (Ebib will log a message
about this when this happens.)

   To see what filters are currently stored, use `F V'. If you want to
rename a filter, you can do so with `F R'.

   Note that cancelling a filter with `F c' does not delete it from the
list of stored filters, it will remain available for later application.
If you want to delete a filter from the list of stored filters, use `F
d'. You can also delete all stored filters with `F D'. These deletion
commands do not ask for confirmation, but if you delete any filters by
accident, you can reload them from `~/.emacs.d/ebib-filters' with `F l'.


File: ebib.info,  Node: Properties of Filtered Databases,  Prev: Storing and Saving Filters,  Up: Filters

3.11.4 Properties of Filtered Databases
---------------------------------------

When a filter is active, there are a few things that are not possible
or function differently. First, it is not possible to add or delete
entries, either interactively or by merging or exporting. Exporting
from a filtered database or saving a filtered database is also
disabled. (The reasons for these limitations are mainly historic and
they may be lifted in future version). Editing existing entries is
possible, however. Note that if the entry doesn't match the filter
anymore after the edit, it doesn't disappear from view. In order to
reapply the filter, press `F r'.

   It is also possible to mark entries. Marked entries stay marked when
you cancel the filter, so in order to do something with all the entries
matching a filter, you can mark them all in the filter view with `; m',
then cancel the filter and perform an action on them.

   Although a filtered database cannot be saved, it is possible to
write the filtered entries to a file. To do so, use `F W'. This command
also writes all the `@string' definitions and the `@preamble', so you
end up with a complete `.bib' file. (Note that this is in fact the same
command as the menu option "Save Database As". This command behaves
differently depending on whether a filter is active. If there is, only
the filtered entries are written to the new file and the original
database remains open. If no filter is active, all the entries are
written and the database in Ebib is renamed.)

   One final note: of all the filter-related commands, `~', `F c', `F
r', `F s' and `F v' and of course the special function of `F w' are
only available when a filter is active. The other commands operate on
the stored filters and can be used when no filter is active.


File: ebib.info,  Node: The Multiline Edit Buffer,  Next: The Options Menu,  Prev: Filters,  Up: Advanced Features

3.12 The Multiline Edit Buffer
==============================

As mentioned several times before, Ebib has a special multiline edit
buffer, which is used to edit field values that contain newlines
(so-called _multiline fields_), and also to edit the contents of the
`@preamble' command. This section discusses the details of this buffer.

   Ebib enters multiline edit mode in one of three cases: when you edit
the `@preamble' definition, when you hit `l' in the entry buffer to
edit the current field as multiline, or when you hit `e' on the
`annote' field, or on a field whose value already is multiline.

   The mode that is used in the multiline edit buffer is
user-configurable. The default value is `text-mode', but if you prefer
to use some other mode, you can specify this through the customisation
options. (Personally, I use `markdown-mode' in the multiline edit
buffer, so that I can use `Markdown'
(http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write annotations,
which provides an easy way to create headers, use bold and italic,
etc., in plain text.)

   Three commands are relevant for interacting with Ebib when you're in
the multiline edit buffer, which are bound to key sequences in the
minor mode `ebib-multiline-edit-mode', which is activated automatically
in the multiline edit buffer.

   `ebib-quit-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | q', leaves the multiline
edit buffer and stores the text in the database. If you invoke this
command when you've deleted all contents of the buffer (including the
final newline!) and you were editing a field value or the `@preamble',
the field value or preamble is deleted. (This is in fact the _only_ way
to delete the `@preamble' definition. Field values on the other hand
can also be deleted by hitting `x' or `d' on them in the entry buffer.)
If you were editing a `@string' value, Ebib will just complain, because
string definitions cannot be empty.

   `ebib-cancel-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | c', also leaves the
multiline edit buffer, but it does so without storing the text. The
original value of the field, string or preamble will be retained. If
the text was modified, Ebib will ask for a confirmation before leaving
the buffer.

   `ebib-save-from-multiline-edit', bound to `C-c | s', can be used in
the multiline edit buffer to save the database. This command first
stores the text in the database and then saves it. Because Ebib does
not do an autosave of the current database, it is advisable to save the
database manually every now and then to prevent data loss in case of
crashes. It would be annoying to have to leave the multiline edit
buffer every time you want to do this, so this command has been
provided to allow you to do this from within the buffer.

   Admittedly, the key combinations of the multiline edit buffer are
somewhat awkward. The reason for this is that these commands are part
of a minor mode, which restricts the available keys to combinations of
`C-c' plus a non-alphanumeric character. However, it is possible to
change the key commands, if you wish. Ebib itself provides a method to
change the second key of these commands: see *note Modifying Key
Bindings: #modifying-key-bindings. for details. You could change the
`|' to e.g., `c' or `C-c', if these do not conflict with any key
commands in the major mode used for the multiline edit buffer.

   Even more drastically, you could put something like the following in
your `~/.emacs':

(eval-after-load 'ebib
  '(progn
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-c" 'ebib-quit-multiline-edit)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-q" 'ebib-cancel-multiline-edit)
     (define-key ebib-multiline-mode-map
                 "\C-c\C-s" 'ebib-save-from-multiline-edit)))

   This sets up `C-c C-c', `C-c C-q' and `C-c C-s' for use in the
multiline edit buffer. Since such key combinations are restricted for
use with major modes, however, Ebib cannot set these up automatically,
but as an Emacs user, you are free do do as you like, of course.


File: ebib.info,  Node: The Options Menu,  Prev: The Multiline Edit Buffer,  Up: Advanced Features

3.13 The Options Menu
=====================

In the index buffer, Ebib's menu has an Options submenu. This menu
gives you quick access to Ebib's customisation buffer, and it also
provides checkboxes for several settings that can be toggled on and
off. All of these settings have defaults that can be defined in the
customisation buffer. Setting or unsetting them in the Options menu
only changes them for the duration of your Emacs session, it doesn't
affect the default setting.

   The same is true for the printing options that are in the Print
menu. When set or unset in the menu, the default values specified in
the customisation buffer do not change.

   You can define a different set of citation commands for each major
mode. There is a catch-all option `any', which is chosen when the major
mode from which `ebib-insert-bibtex-key' is not on the list. By
default, this is used for LaTeX citations, because not everybody uses
AUCTeX's `LaTeX-mode'.

optional fields, you can define an entry that has only obligatory or
only optional fields.

   The default entry types and fields are the following:

5.2 Modifying Key Bindings
==========================

If you are unhappy about Ebib's standard key bindings and would like to
change them, or if you would like to bind a command that is only
available through the menu to a key, you can do so by creating a file
`~/.ebibrc' and writing your preferred key bindings in it. A key
binding definition is built up as follows:

(ebib-key <buffer> <key> <command>)

   `<buffer>' is either `index', `entry' or `strings', for the
corresponding buffer. `<key>' is a standard Emacs key description, and
`<command>' is the Ebib command to be associated with the key. The
commands that can be used here are listed in *note The Ebib Buffers:
#the-ebib-buffers. Note that it is possible to bind more than one key
to a single function: just add as many `ebib-key' statements as
necessary.

   As an example, the following binds `C-s' to `ebib-search' in the
index buffer, so that the database can be searched with `C-s' as well
as with `/':

(ebib-key index "\C-s" ebib-search)

   If you want to unbind a key, you can simply leave out `<command>'.
So if you want to bind the command `ebib-delete-entry' to `D' rather
than `d', you need to put the following in `.ebibrc':

(ebib-key index "D" ebib-delete-entry)
(ebib-key index "d")

   The first line binds `D' to the command `ebib-delete-entry'. The
second line unbinds `d'.

   If a command can be called with a prefix key (as for example
`ebib-delete-entry' can), `ebib-key' will automatically rebind the
prefixed version as well. So in the example above, the first line not
only binds `D', it also binds `; D'. Similarly, the second line not
only unbinds `d', but also `; d'.

   Note that if you bind the print commands to a key
(`ebib-print-entries' and `ebib-latex-entries') they are automatically
set up to accept the prefix key as well.

   It is also possible to redefine the prefix key itself. To do this,
you must specify `select-prefix' for `<buffer>'. The value of
`<command>' is irrelevant here, so it can be left out:

(ebib-key select-prefix ":")

   This sets up `:' as the new prefix key. Doing this automatically
unbinds the existing prefix key.

   As a final option, `ebib-key' allows you to redefine the second key
in the key bindings of the multiline edit buffer:

(ebib-key multiline "&")

   This piece of code changes the commands `C-c | q', `C-c | c' and
`C-c | s' to `C-c & q', `C-c & c' and `C-c & s', respectively.
