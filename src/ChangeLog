2008-06-15  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-read-string): bug fix: ebib would choke on bibtex
	entries that have a space after the entry type but before the
	opening parenthesis/brace. bug reported and fix provided by Rupert
	Swarbrick.

2008-05-31  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-index-window-size): "key buffer" in the doc string
	changed to "index buffer".

2008-05-30  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-call-file-viewer): modified to use
	file-name-extension. is probably a safer bet that what i used
	before: (last1 (split-string file "\\.")).

2008-05-21  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-add-entry): bugfix: moved the code that creates

	* ebib.el: fixed doc strings.

2008-04-20  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-entry-summary): modified: if the ebib buffers are
	visible, instead of putting the output in a temp buffer, the
	relevant entry is displayed in the ebib buffers.
	(ebib) help mode removed.
	(ebib-show-log): modified: in split-frame layout the window's
	dedicated flag must be temporarily unset in order to switch to the
	strings-buffer.
	(ebib-quit-log-buffer): same.
	(ebib-set-index-highlight): modified: move cursor to beginning of
	line after setting the highlight.

	(ebib-set-strings-highlight): same.
	(ebib-edit-entry): removed goto-char and switch-to-buffer.
	(line-number-at-pos): this is called line-number in xemacs, so an
	alias is defined.
	(ebib-match-paren-forward): added "" to error, to keep xemacs from complaining.
	(ebib-match-quote-forward): same.
	(ebib-setup-windows): added delete-other-windows in full-frame layout.
	(ebib-export-to-db): modified to use gensym.

	(ebib-edit-strings): modified: in split-frame layout the window's
	dedicated flag must be temporarily unset in order to switch to the
	strings-buffer.
	(ebib-quit-strings-buffer): same.

2008-04-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib): added nil as second argument (norecord) to
	select-window.
	(ebib-setup-windows): modified. now uses ebib-layout to choose the
	desired window layout.
	(ebib-delete-window): removed. i really don't think we need this.

2008-04-18  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-search-next): changed $ in search string to space:
	with ebib-index-display-fields, index entries now have a space
	after the entry key.
	(ebib-call-file-viewer): new.
	(ebib-file-regexp): added a space to the regexp. (!)
	(ebib-browse-url-in-field): changed the doc string.
	(ebib-view-file-in-field): new.
	(ebib-view-file-in-field): new. bound to 'f' in the entry buffer.
	(ebib-file-associations): changed default value: paths removed
	from the programs, as start-process searches the user's PATH.

2008-04-17  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-view-file): new. bound to 'f' in the index
	buffer. (which means that 'f' is no longer bound to
	ebib-print-filename.

2008-04-11  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-layout): new.
	* ebib.el (ebib-add-entry): used ebib-display-entry to insert the
	new entry in the buffer.

2008-04-11  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-add-entry): inserted a space in the format string
	that puts the new entry key into the buffer. this way
	ebib-set-index-highlight doesn't put the end of the highlight at
	the next line.

2008-03-26  Morgan Veyret  <patzy@appart.kicks-ass.net>

	* ebib.el (ebib): changed to check if ebib is visible
	already. window setup moved to ebib-setup-windows.
	(ebib-setup-windows): new.
	(ebib-delete-windows): new.

	buffer.

2008-03-26  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-index-mode): set truncate-lines to t, which works
	better if ebib-index-dislay-fields is set.
	(ebib-set-index-highlight): changed so that it highlights the
	entire line if ebib-index-display-fields is set.

2008-03-25  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-additional-fields): added 'file' to the default
	value.
	(ebib-url-regexp): changed doc string.

	skip-chars-forward because of ebib-index-display-fields.
	(ebib-select-entry): same.

2007-11-15  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-syntax-table): modified the syntax classes for ()
	and [] to punctuation character. Not that it really matters, though.

2007-11-10  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el: removed empty lines after the first line of doc
	strings. (this is apparently not an Emacs convention...)

	(ebib-create-buffers): added initial message to the log buffer.

2007-11-08  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-lower): added bury-buffer command for ebib-log-buffer.
	(ebib-quit): added kill-buffer commands for ebib-log-buffer and ebib-strings-buffer.

2007-11-07  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-merge-bibtex-file): added final call to ebib-log,
	to insert "\n\f\n".
	(ebib-find-bibtex-entries): added "Line" to warning message.
	(ebib-read-string): same.
	(ebib-read-entry): same.
	(ebib-log): added save-excursion, so that the ebib log buffer is
	only current during this function. also modified to no longer set
	ebib-log-error to 0 unconditionally, instead checks if it's still
	nil. also modified to use cond.
	(ebib-match-brace-forward): new. this function handles braces {}
	only.
	(ebib-match-paren-forward): modified to handle parenthesis () and
	braces {} differently.
	(ebib-match-quote-forward): modified: logs an error when no
	closing quote is found, and moves point to the char after the
	opening quote.

2007-11-07  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-log-error): new.
	(ebib-create-buffers): added creating the log buffer.
	(ebib-find-bibtex-entries): modified to use ebib-log.
	(ebib-read-string): same.
	(ebib-read-entry): same.

2007-11-06  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-customize): added doc string.
	(ebib-log-buffer): new.
	(ebib-log): new.
	(ebib-load-bibtex-file): modified to use ebib-log.
	(ebib-merge-bibtex-file): same.

2007-11-02  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-syntax-table): new.
	(ebib-load-bibtex-file): modified to use with-syntax-table.
	(ebib-merge-bibtex-file): same.
	(ebib-import): same.
	(ebib-store-multiline-text): check-parens removed.

2007-10-31  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-init): removed test whether ~/.ebibrc exists; use
	second (optional) argument to load instead.

2007-10-29  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-marked-face): turned into a customisable option.
	(ebib-fill-index-buffer): modified to use ebib-marked-face as a
	face, rather than a variable.
	(ebib-mark-entry): same.

2007-10-29  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-fill-index-buffer): changed mapcar to mapc
	(prevents compiler warning). fix provided by Leo
	<sdl.web at gmail.com>.
	(ebib): added autoload cookie. suggested by Leo
	<sdl.web at gmail.com>.
	(ebib-mark-entry): fixed typo: '(face ,ebib-marked-face) to `(face
	,ebib-marked-face). fix provided by Leo <sdl.web at gmail.com>.

2007-10-22  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib): modified to store the buffer from which ebib is
	called in ebib-push-buffer, so that it becomes the default for
	pushing entries. Thanks to Sinisa Pajevic for the suggestion.

2007-10-20  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-redisplay-current-field): modified. now redisplays
	the entire entry buffer is the current field is crossref. (cutting
	the value from the crossref field would leave the inherited field
	values visible.)
	(ebib-import): modified to use insert-buffer-substring, rather
	than buffer-string and insert. this way, there is no need to
	temporarily store the buffer contents in a variable.
	(ebib-get-field-highlighted): modified so that it doesn't produce
	an error if an entry contains a crossref to an entry that does not
	exist.
	(ebib-get-local-databases): variable bibfiles removed from the let.

2007-10-20  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-local-bibtex-filenames): renamed from
	ebib-local-bibtex-filname. this is now a list of strings, rather
	than a string. thanks to Sinisa Pajevic for pointing out that a
	\bibliography command can contain more than one .bib file.
	(ebib-extract-bibfiles): removed.
	(ebib-get-local-databases): modified to return a list of database
	filenames. also now uses insert-buffer-substring, rather than a
	combination of buffer-string and insert.
	(ebib-insert-bibtex-key): modified so that it can handle multiple
	bibtex files. this reflects the change to
	ebib-local-bibtex-filenames.
	(ebib-entry-summary): same.

2007-10-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-push-entry-key): new. pushes the current entry
	key, or the marked entry keys, to a buffer, using
	ebib-insertion-strings. thanks to Sinisa Pajevic for suggesting
	this feature.
	(ebib-key "p"): changed to ebib-push-entry-key.
	(ebib-key "r"): new. assigned to ebib-edit-preamble.
	(ebib-prefixed-functions): ebib-push-entry-key added.
	(ebib-push-buffer): new. holds the name of the last buffer to
	which an entry was pushed, to present it as default in the next
	push operation.
	(ebib-insertion-strings): modified default value: 0 added.

2007-10-11  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-get-field-highlighted): modified so as to show
	field values inherited from a cross-referenced entry.
	(ebib-crossref-face): new.
	(ebib-edit-crossref): modified to redisplay the entire entry
	buffer, not just the current field.

2007-07-29  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-store-multiline-text): added a check to make sure
	the text in the buffer doesn't contain unbalanced braces.
	(ebib-filter-to-virtual-db): changed to give more feedback in the
	minibuffer about what the user is doing.

2007-06-26  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-insert-bibtex-key): changed to show the cite
	command that the user has selected through the prefix argument.

2007-04-26  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-standard-url-field): doc string modified.

2007-04-06  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-allow-identical-fields): new.
	(ebib-find-bibtex-fields): modified so as to use
	ebib-allow-identical-fields.

2007-03-30  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-url-regexp): bug fix: removed \l from default
	value.

2007-03-29  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el: Ebib 1.3.0 released.

2007-03-29  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-index-mode-map): added "u" key.
	(ebib-url-field): new.
	(ebib-url-regexp): new.
	(ebib-browse-url): new.
	(ebib-call-browser): new.
	(ebib-entry-mode-map): added "u" key.
	(ebib-browse-url-in-field): new.
	(ebib-call-browser-command): new.

2007-03-28  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (raw-p): regexp "\".*?\" replaced with
	"\"[^\"]*?\"". The dot doesn't match \n, so a multiline string
	enclosed by double quotes was incorrectly recognised as a raw
	string.

2007-03-27  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-export-entry): ebib-execute-when
	removed. ebib-marked-p replaced with ebib-called-with-prefix.
	(ebib-export-single-entry): added ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-export-marked-entries): same.
	(ebib-prefix-map): new. (actually, this is ebib-semicolon-map
	reintroduced under a new name.)
	(ebib-index-mode-map): binding of the prefix key ";" changed to
	ebib-prefix-map.
	(ebib-key): modified so that if the user redefines a key in
	ebib-index-mode-map, it checks whether the function is bound in
	ebib-prefix-map as well, and if so, binds it to the same
	key. Furthermore, if the user unbinds a key, it is unbound in
	ebib-prefix-map as well.
	(ebib-marked-p): removed.
	(ebib-prefixed-functions): new.
	(ebib-prefix-key): new.
	(ebib-key): modified so that it unsets the current prefix key if
	the user redefines the prefix key with mark-prefix.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): key bindings no longer done in the defvar
	definition, but at top level with ebib-key. Using ebib-key has the
	advantage that ebib-prefix-map is automatically set up correctly
	as well.

2007-03-26  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-called-with-prefix): new.
	(ebib-marked-p): new.
	(ebib-prefix-key): new.
	(ebib-key): added clause for mark-prefix.
	(ebib-delete-marked-entries): removed.
	(ebib-delete-entry): modified to handle the prefix key.
	(ebib-export-entry): modified to call either of two helper
	functions, depending on whether it was called with or without
	prefix key.
	(ebib-export-single-entry): new. helper function for
	ebib-export-entry.
	(ebib-export-marked-entries): changed into helper function for
	ebib-export-entry.
	(ebib-print-database): removed.
	(ebib-print-marked-entries): removed.
	(ebib-semicolon-map): removed.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): binding for L changed to
	ebib-latex-entries, and binding for P changed to
	ebib-print-entries.
	(ebib-print-entries): made interactive and modified to handle
	marked entries.
	(ebib-latex-database): removed.
	(ebib-latex-marked-entries): removed.
	(ebib-latex-entries): made interactive and modified to handle
	marked entries.
	(ebib-mark-all): removed.

2007-03-25  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-remove-entry-from-db): modified so that a deleted
	entry is also deleted from edb-marked-entries if it's there. This
	avoids problems when the user deletes a marked entry, and also
	when he renames the entry key of a marked entry.
	(ebib-delete-marked-entries): no longer sets edb-marked-entries to
	nil, as the entries are removed one by one by
	ebib-remove-entry-from-db.
	(ebib-edit-keyname): modified so that it marks the renamed entry
	if it was marked before the renaming.
	(ebib-unmark-all): renamed to ebib-mark-all.
	(ebib-mark-all): modified so that it marks all entries if there
	are no marked entries.
	(ebib-mark-entry): real-db removed from ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-export-entry): modified to include the entry name in the
	messages passed to ebib-export-to-db and ebib-export-to-file.
	(ebib-export-string): same with string abbreviation.

2007-03-24  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-export-string): modified to make use of
	ebib-export-to-db and ebib-export-to-file.
	(ebib-export-all-strings): same.
	(ebib-export-preamble): same.
	(ebib-export-marked-entries): new.
	(ebib-semicolon-map): new key "x" added.
	(propertize): new.
	(ebib-write-database): rewritten to stop XEmacs from
	complaining. (See arch log for details.)
	(ebib-export-to-file): modified documentation string, as it said
	something about insert-fn that isn't correct.
	(ebib-execute-helper): added marked-entries.
	(ebib-delete-marked-entries): modified to use marked-entries.
	(ebib-export-marked-entries): same.
	(ebib-delete-marked-entries): added default clause to
	ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-print-entries): new. contains most of the code of former
	ebib-print-database.
	(ebib-print-database): modified to use ebib-print-entries.
	(ebib-print-marked-entries): new.
	(define-prefix-command): new keys "P", "L" and "m".
	(ebib-mark-entry): modified: no longer adds the text properties to
	the entry key in the database, just in the index buffer.
	(ebib-fill-index-buffer): modified so that it adds a highlight to
	marked entries.
	(ebib-latex-entries): new. contains most of the code of former
	ebib-latex-database.
	(ebib-latex-database): modified to use ebib-latex-entries.
	(ebib-latex-marked-entries): new.
	(ebib-unmark-all): new.

2007-03-23  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-export-to-db): new.
	(ebib-export-to-file): new.
	(ebib-export-entry): modified to make use of ebib-export-to-db and
	ebib-export-to-file.

2007-03-20  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-edit-field): changed to unconditionally add braces
	around the text the user enters. Formerly, this was done through
	from-raw, which meant that if the user typed braces around the
	text, these would disappear.

2007-03-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (add-to-listq): added a test for Emacs < 22.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): removed 'ebib-index-mode-map argument to
	make-keymap. Emacs officially doesn't even allow it, and in XEmacs
	it's optional.
	(ebib-entry-mode-map): same.
	(ebib-strings-mode-map): same.
	(ebib-help-mode-map): same.
	(ebib-semicolon-map): new.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): added ";" key.
	(ebib-remove-entry-from-db): bug fix: would delete the key of the
	current entry from the keys list, regardless of which entry was
	actually deleted.
	(ebib-semicolon-map): added "d" key.
	(ebib-delete-marked-entries): new.
	(ebib-entry-mode-map): bindings of C-x b and C-x k changed to
	'undefined.
	(disabled): removed. The predefined function undefined does the
	same thing.

2007-03-13  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-filter-to-virtual-db): removed the check for the
	`type' field. What was actually meant was the `type*' field, and
	since this is not in ebib-unique-field-list anyway, the user isn't
	able to filter on it.

2007-03-12  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-mark-entry): added again for the 1.3 branch.

2007-03-12  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el: ebib 1.2.0 released.

2007-03-12  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-mark-entry): removed in preparation for release.

2007-03-12  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-print-database): bugfix: if ebib-print-tempfile is
	set to "", which is its default value, the body of if-str would
	not be executed.
	(ebib-latex-database): same.

2007-03-10  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-latex-database): new.

	(ebib-print-multiline): new.
	(ebib-latex-preamble): new.
	(ebib-print-tempfile): new.
	(ebib-print-database): modified to use ebib-print-preamble,
	ebib-print-multiline and ebib-print-tempfile.
	(ebib-latex-database): added real-db to ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-timestamp-format): new.
	(ebib-insert-entry): modified to use format-time-string and ebib-timestamp-format.
	(ebib-format-entry): same.
	(ebib-yank-field-contents): renamed from ebib-paste-field-contents.

2007-03-08  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-print-database): new.

2007-03-06  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	(ebib-index-scroll-up): new. replaces ebib-entry-page-down.
	(ebib-follow-crossref): new.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): added "F" key.

2007-03-02  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-delete-entry): removed optional argument
	entry-key, as it wasn't used at all.

2007-03-01  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-paste-field-contents): sets this-command to t if
	called illegally. that way, a second consecutive call to this
	function is also recognised as illegal.

2007-02-26  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-paste-field-contents): doc string slightly expanded.

2007-02-25  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-paste-field-contents): added test for crossref field.
	(ebib-paste-field-contents): modified so that repeatedly calling
	this command walks around the kill ring, just like C-y/M-y.

2007-02-23  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-move-to-field): bug fix: if the field being moved
	to is type*, used to search for 'type', causing confusion with an
	actual type field (e.g. in the entry type incollection.) now just
	moves to (point-min).
	(ebib-set-modified): bug fix: the modification flag of the index
	buffer would be (re)set, regardless of whether it actually holds
	the database whose modification flag is being (re)set.

2007-02-22  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-execute-when): changed so that it does not produce
	a spurious and if the envs list of a form only contains one element.

2007-02-21  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-print-filter): changed the argument of interactive
	from "p" to "P", to obtain the raw prefix argument.

	(ebib-print-filter): added a default-clause to ebib-execute-when,
	to produce a beep.
	(ebib-prev-entry): same.
	(ebib-next-entry): same.
	(ebib-add-entry): same.
	(ebib-goto-first-entry): same.

	(ebib-entry-page-down): same.
	(ebib-write-database): same.
	(ebib-delete-entry): same.
	(ebib-select-entry): same.
	(ebib-export-entry): same.
	(ebib-search): same.
	(ebib-search-next): same.
	(ebib-edit-strings): same.
	(ebib-edit-preamble): same.
	(ebib-export-preamble): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-and): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-or): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-not): same.

2007-02-20  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-filter-to-virtual-db): fixed a bug: the additional
	fields weren't included in the collection.
	(ebib-edit-field): spurious progn removed.
	(ebib-execute-helper): wrapped in an eval-and-compile because
	otherwise XEmacs complains that the symbol ebib-execute-helper's
	value as function is void.
	(safe-write-region): new. GNU Emacs has an optional argument to
	write-region that can be used to make sure the user doesn't
	inadvertently overwrite an already existing file. XEmacs does not
	have this argument.
	(ebib-write-database): modified to use safe-write-region.
	(ebib-insertion-strings): changed the default value from nil to
	'((1 . "\\cite{%s}")).

2007-02-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-index-mode-map): changed binding for
	ebib-merge-bibtex-file from "m" to "M".
	(ebib-index-mode-map): added binding "m" for ebib-mark-entry.
	(ebib-mark-entry): new.
	(ebib-marked-face): new. needed to accommodate xemacs. there must
	be a better way to do this... Note that in xemacs, i know of no
	better way than to use '(face highlight) for both the overlay
	marking the current entry and to mark selected entries. that means
	that you cannot tell if the current entry is selected or not. gnu
	emacs has highlight and :inverse-video. (though the former may be
	obsoleted at some point?)
	(ebib-fill-index-buffer): changed to accommodate xemacs. (see
	comment in the source.)
	(ebib-index-buffer-help): updated.
	(ebib-execute-when): new.
	(ebib-execute-helper): new.
	(when-entries): removed. its functionality is now covered by
	ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-write-database): modified to use ebib-execute-when and if-str.
	(ebib-export-entry): modified to use ebib-execute-when. also added
	a check to make sure that the goal database is not virtual.
	(ebib-export-preamble): same.
	(ebib-export-all-strings): added a check to make sure the goal
	database is not virtual.
	(ebib-export-string): same.
	(ebib-prev-entry): modified to use ebib-execute-when.
	(ebib-next-entry): same.
	(ebib-add-entry): same.
	(ebib-close-database): same.
	(ebib-goto-first-entry): same.

	(ebib-edit-keyname): same.
	(ebib-entry-page-up): same.
	(ebib-entry-page-down): same.
	(ebib-save-database): same.
	(ebib-save-current-database): same.

	(ebib-remove-key-from-buffer): same.
	(ebib-select-entry): same.
	(ebib-search): same.
	(ebib-search-next): same.
	(ebib-edit-strings): same.
	(ebib-edit-preamble): same.
	(ebib-next-database): same.
	(ebib-prev-database): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-and): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-or): same.
	(ebib-virtual-db-not): same.
	(ebib-print-filter): same.

2007-02-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el: ebib-1.1.4 released.

2007-02-19  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-filter-to-virtual-db): changed the collection to
	contain strings rather than symbols, because xemacs requires that.

2007-02-18  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (add-to-listq): new. introduced mainly because xemacs
	doesn't allow the fourth argument to add-to-list. (actually, i'm
	not sure if emacs 21.4 supports it...)

2007-02-13  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-quit): set ebib-strings-highlight to nil.

2007-02-11  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-unique-field-list): new. used for TAB-completion
	in ebib-filter-to-virtual-db.
	(ebib-set-entry-types-hash): modified to set
	ebib-unique-field-list.
	(ebib-key): modified to keep the cond statement out of the
	expansion.
	(ebib-create-new-database): modified to take an optional database
	argument: if supplied, returns a copy of that database.
	(ebib-index-mode-map): added "&", "|", "~" and "V".
	(ebib-virtual-db-and): new.
	(ebib-virtual-db-or): new.
	(ebib-virtual-db-not): new.
	(ebib-filter-to-virtual-db): new.
	(ebib-create-virtual-db): new.
	(contains): new.
	(ebib-run-filter): new.
	(ebib-print-filter): new.
	(ebib-write-database): modified to handle virtual databases.
	(ebib-edit-entry): modified to exclude virtual databases.
	(ebib-edit-keyname): same.
	(ebib-save-current-database): same.
	(ebib-save-database): same.

	(ebib-add-entry): same.
	(ebib-delete-entry): same.
	(ebib-export-entry): same.
	(ebib-edit-strings): same.
	(ebib-edit-preamble): same.
	(ebib-export-preamble): same.
	(ebib-import): same.
	(ebib-fill-entry-buffer): modified so that it does not result in
	an error if the current entry does not exist. This is needed in
	case the user deletes an entry from a database that has a virtual
	database that containe that entry.
	(ebib-format-entry): put (eq key 'timestamp) first in the and
	clause. no need to check timestamp and ebib-use-timestamp for any
	other field.
	(ebib-write-database): modified so that when a virtual database is
	written to a file, it doesn't attempt to put an entry that is
	still in a virtual database's keys-list but has been deleted in
	the source database into the new database. (note: this is still
	not the proper way to handle this. we need to find a clean way to
	handle the consequences of an entry being deleted in a source
	database.)

2007-02-10  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (when-entries): included a declare indent statement.
	(with-buffer-writable): same.
	(edb): added fields `name' and `virtual'.
	(ebib-fill-index-buffer): modified to use edb-name.
	(ebib-load-bibtex-file): same.
	(ebib-write-database): same.
	(ebib-search-in-entry): added optional field argument.

2007-02-04  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-goto-next-set): adapted to make use of
	ebib-move-to-field.
	(ebib-goto-prev-set): same.
	(defentry): removed.
	(ebib-preload): removed.
	(ebib-additional-fields): removed.
	(ebib-insert-entry): modified to insert a timestamp, depending on
	the argument TIMESTAMP and on the setting of EBIB-USE-TIMESTAMP.
	(ebib-add-entry): modified: it no longer adds a timestamp
	itself (as it did after the change two days ago) but just requests
	ebib-insert-entry to do so.
	(ebib-read-entry): modified to request insertion of a timestamp.
	(ebib-edit-keyname): modified so as to explicitly NOT insert a
	timestamp.
	(ebib-export-entry): modified so as to request insertion of a
	timestamp, both when exporting to another database and to a file.
	(ebib-find-bibtex-entries): modified: timestamp argument
	added. This argument is simply passed on to ebib-read-entry.
	(ebib-load-bibtex-file): modified so that no timestamp is inserted
	into the entries read from file.
	(ebib-import): modified to request insertion of a timestamp.
	(ebib-format-entry): modified to insert a timestamp if required.
	(ebib-export-entry): fixed a bug that kept ebib-export-filename
	from being set.
	(ebib-export-preamble): same.

2007-02-02  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-use-timestamp): new.

	ebib-use-timestamp is set.

2007-01-23  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-keys-window-size): new.

	* ebib.el (ebib-edit-crossref): fixed a bug that caused
	ebib-set-modified not to be executed.
	(ebib-set-modified): fixed. save-excursion should not be part of
	the body of UNLESS.
	(ebib-quit): ebib-default-type no longer set to nil. (quiting and
	restarting ebib would leave it set to nil.)
	(ebib-save-xrefs-first): new.
	(ebib-compare-xrefs): new.
	(ebib-format-database): modified to put crossreferencing entries
	first.

2006-11-13  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	the entry types through the customisation buffer possible.
	(defentry): modified, so that an entry defined with defentry is
	also added to the list ebib-entry-types.
	(ebib-additional-fields): renamed from ebib-ign-fields; modified
	to check whether a field is already in the list before it is
	added, so that it is not added twice when Ebib is closed and
	restarted in the same Emacs session.
	(ebib-find-bibtex-entries): added modify-syntax-entry, so that
	users can type (e.g.) "o to create umlaut-o.

	get rid of an error message when the last entry is deleted.
	(ebib-find-end-of-field): fixed a nasty bug that occurred when
	reading a .bib-file with an entry in which the last field is raw
	and is immediately followed by the closing brace. Thanks to Thomas
	Schmitz for bringing this to my attention.

2006-09-14  Joost Kremers  <joostkremers@yahoo.com>

	* ebib.el (ebib-ign-fields): code, uri and location removed.

	taken as the matching quote if it is escaped by a backslash.

2005-11-02  Steve Youngs  <steve@sxemacs.org>

	* ebib.el (ebib-init): Copy the "initial keys" keymap into
	`ebib-keys-mode-map'.
	(ebib-initial-keys-map): Define all the keys inside the variable
	definition instead of at top level.
	(ebib-full-keys-map): Ditto.  Also make this keymap's parent be
	`ebib-initial-keys-map' to save on double defining some keys.
	(ebib-switch-to-database-nth): New.  Convenience function for
	switching between databases.
	(ebib-fill-keys-buffer): Set the local keymap to `ebib-keys-mode-map'.
	(ebib-load-bibtex-file): Copy the "full keys" keymap into
	`ebib-keys-mode-map'.
	(ebib-close-database): Copy the "initial keys" keymap into
	`ebib-keys-mode-map' and reset the local map.
	(ebib-fields-mode-map): Define the keys in the variable definition
	instead of at top level.
	(ebib-strings-mode-map): Ditto.
	(ebib-help-mode-map): Ditto.
