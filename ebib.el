;;; Commentary:

;; Ebib is a BibTeX database manager that runs in GNU Emacs. With Ebib, you
;; can create and manage .bib-files, all within Emacs. It supports @string
;; and @preamble definitions, multi-line field values, searching, and
;; integration with Emacs' (La)TeX mode.

;; See the Ebib manual for usage and installation instructions.

;; The latest release version of Ebib, contact information and mailing list
;; can be found at <http://ebib.sourceforge.net>. Development sources can be
;; found at <https://github.com/joostkremers/ebib>.

;; would then be incorrectly recognised as non-raw. so we need to do
;; the following: take out everything that is between braces or
;; quotes, and see if anything is left. if there is, the original
;; string was raw, otherwise it was not.
;;
;; so i first check whether the string begins with { or ". if not, we
;; certainly have a raw string. (RAW-P recognises this through the default
;; clause of the COND.) if the first character is { or ", we first take out
;; every occurrence of backslash-escaped { and } or ", so that the rest of
;; the function does not get confused over them.
;;
;; then, if the first character is {, i use `remove-from-string' to take out
;; every occurrence of the regex "{[^{]*?}", which translates to "the
;; smallest string that starts with { and ends with }, and does not contain
;; another {. IOW, it takes out the innermost braces and their
;; contents. because braces may be embedded, we have to repeat this step
;; until no more balanced braces are found in the string. (note that it
;; would be unwise to check for just the occurrence of { or }, because that
;; would throw RAW-P in an infinite loop if a string contains an unbalanced
;; brace.)
;;
;; for strings beginning with " i do the same, except that it is not
;; necessary to repeat this in a while loop, for the simple reason that
;; strings surrounded with double quotes cannot be embedded; i.e.,
;; "ab"cd"ef" is not a valid (BibTeX) string, while {ab{cd}ef} is.
;;
;; note: because these strings are to be fed to BibTeX and ultimately
;; (La)TeX, it might seem that we don't need to worry about strings
;; containing unbalanced braces, because (La)TeX would choke on them. but
